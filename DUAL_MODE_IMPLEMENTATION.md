## üìã REMAINING IMPLEMENTATION

### Phase 2: Conditional Tab Layout

**File to modify:** `apps/partner/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`

**Changes needed:**
1. Read `partnerAccountType` from AsyncStorage on mount
2. Conditionally render tabs based on account type
3. Keep freelance tabs as-is
4. Show different tabs for barbershop mode

**Freelance Tabs (Current - Keep):**
```typescript
1. dashboard.tsx  - Dashboard
2. jobs.tsx       - Jobs
3. schedule.tsx   - Schedule
4. earnings.tsx   - Earnings
5. profile.tsx    - Profile
```

**Barbershop Tabs (New):**
```typescript
1. dashboard-shop.tsx  - Dashboard (shop version)
2. bookings.tsx        - Appointments
3. staff.tsx           - Staff Management
4. shop.tsx            - Shop Profile
5. reports.tsx         - Analytics & Reports
```

**Implementation:**
```typescript
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function TabLayout() {
  const [accountType, setAccountType] = useState<'freelance' | 'barbershop'>('freelance');
  
  useEffect(() => {
    AsyncStorage.getItem('partnerAccountType').then(type => {
      if (type) setAccountType(type as 'freelance' | 'barbershop');
    });
  }, []);
  
  if (accountType === 'freelance') {
    // Return current tab structure
  } else {
    // Return barbershop tab structure
  }
}
```
