# Quick Fix Reference Card

## üî• IMMEDIATE ACTION

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Run This SQL in Supabase Dashboard
Copy and paste this into Supabase SQL Editor and run it:

```sql
-- Drop duplicate policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_update_own" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable update for users based on id" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own barber record" ON barbers;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "barbers_update_own" ON barbers;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable update for users based on user_id" ON barbers;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Barbers can update their own record" ON barbers;

-- Create single clean policies
CREATE POLICY "profiles_update_policy" ON profiles
    FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
    USING (auth.uid() = id)
    WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "barbers_update_policy" ON barbers
    FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
    USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
    WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Verify
SELECT tablename, policyname, cmd FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename IN ('profiles', 'barbers') AND cmd = 'UPDATE';
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Test the Update
1. Restart your Partner app
2. Go to Profile ‚Üí Edit Profile
3. Change your name, bio, or specializations
4. Click "Save Changes"
5. **Look at the console output** - you'll see detailed logs

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Check the Console Logs

#### ‚úÖ Success looks like:
```
[EditProfile] ‚úÖ Profile updated successfully
[EditProfile] ‚úÖ Barber data updated successfully
[EditProfile] ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ ALL UPDATES SUCCESSFUL
```

#### ‚ùå Failure looks like:
```
[EditProfile] ‚ö†Ô∏è Profile update returned no data - possible RLS issue
```
**OR**
```
[EditProfile] ‚ùå Profile update FAILED
[EditProfile] Error code: 42501
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Verify in Supabase
After a successful save:
- Open Supabase ‚Üí Table Editor
- Check `profiles` table ‚Üí find your user ‚Üí verify `full_name` changed
- Check `barbers` table ‚Üí find your barber ‚Üí verify `bio` and `specializations` changed

## üîç What Changed?

### Code Changes
- Added comprehensive logging to `apps/partner/app/profile/edit.tsx`
- Now shows exactly what's happening at each step
- Detects RLS issues specifically

### SQL Changes
- Removed duplicate RLS policies (these were conflicting)
- Created single, clean UPDATE policy for each table
- Both `USING` and `WITH CHECK` clauses properly set

## üìã Common Error Codes

| Code | Meaning | Fix |
|------|---------|-----|
| 42501 | Permission denied | RLS policy missing or incorrect |
| 42703 | Column doesn't exist | Check table schema |
| 23505 | Unique constraint violation | Duplicate data |
| No error but no data | RLS `WITH CHECK` failing | Policy conditions wrong |

## üÜò Still Not Working?

Run this diagnostic query in Supabase:
```sql
-- Check current policies
SELECT tablename, policyname, cmd, 
       qual as using_clause, 
       with_check as check_clause
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename IN ('profiles', 'barbers')
ORDER BY tablename, cmd;
```

Then send me:
1. The output of the query above
2. The console logs from your app (entire `[EditProfile]` section)
3. Screenshot of the error message
