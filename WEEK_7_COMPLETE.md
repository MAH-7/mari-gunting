## üìã Executive Summary

- ‚úÖ **5-Tab Layout** (Dashboard, Jobs, Schedule, Earnings, Profile)

### What Was Removed:
- ‚ùå **Customer Management** - Not needed for platform-mediated model
- ‚ùå **Customer List Screen** - Jobs tab already shows bookings
- ‚ùå **Customer Details** - Communication stays in platform

## üéØ Completed Features

### ‚ùå Customer Management (Removed)

**Decision:** Removed customer management to align with platform-mediated model (like Uber).

**Rationale:**

- **Platform handles communication:** All customer-provider interactions go through the booking/jobs system
- **Privacy first:** Customers' personal information stays private
- **Jobs tab sufficiency:** All necessary booking info already visible in Jobs tab
- **Cleaner architecture:** Reduces complexity and maintenance burden
- **Scalability:** Easier to manage as platform grows

**Result:** Partner app now has 5 tabs instead of 6, focused on essential provider tools.
