## üìä Progress Dots Pattern

All screens use 8 dots:
```typescript
// Screen 1 (Business Info)
<View style={styles.progressDot, styles.progressActive} />
<View style={styles.progressDot} /> // 7 more

// Screen 2 (Location)
<View style={styles.progressDotCompleted} />
<View style={styles.progressDot, styles.progressActive} />
<View style={styles.progressDot} /> // 6 more

// ... etc
```

---

## üé® UI/UX Guidelines

### Consistent with Barber Flow
- Same colors (#4CAF50 primary)
- Same validation patterns
- Same loading states
- Same back button behavior

### Barbershop-Specific
- More emphasis on location (map)
- Multiple images (cover photos)
- Staff management (dynamic list)
- Business hours (more detailed)

---

## üîß Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
```json
{
  "expo-location": "^16.x",
  "react-native-maps": "^1.x"
}
```

### Supabase Storage Buckets
Create these buckets:
```sql
-- In Supabase dashboard
CREATE barbershop-logos
CREATE barbershop-images  
CREATE barbershop-documents
```

### PostGIS for Location
Already enabled in schema:
```sql
location GEOGRAPHY(POINT, 4326)
```

Save as:
```typescript
const locationPoint = `POINT(${longitude} ${latitude})`;
```

---

## üìÅ Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Simple Screens (2-3 hours)
1. ‚úÖ Business Info (done)
2. Operating Hours (similar to barber working hours)
3. Amenities (simple multi-select)
4. Payout (reuse barber code)

### Phase 2: Complex Screens (4-5 hours)
5. Location (map integration)
6. Documents (multiple image uploads)
7. Staff & Services (dynamic lists)

### Phase 3: Final Screen (1-2 hours)
8. Review & Submit

---

## üöÄ Quick Implementation Strategy

### Option A: Generate All Now
I can create all 7 remaining screens right now (will take 5-10 minutes to generate all files).

### Option B: Build in Phases
- Phase 1 first (simple screens)
- Test them
- Then Phase 2
- Finally Phase 3

### Option C: Most Critical First
1. Location (customers need to find you)
2. Documents (verification needed)
3. Staff & Services (core business info)
4. Operating Hours
5. Amenities
6. Payout
7. Review

---

## üí° Code Reuse Opportunities

### From Barber Flow
- Payout screen (99% same)
- Image upload logic (eKYC ‚Üí Documents)
- Working hours picker (service-details ‚Üí operating-hours)
- Progress indicator (all screens)
- Form validation patterns (all screens)

### New Components Needed
- MapPicker component (location screen)
- DynamicList component (staff & services)
- AmenitiesSelector component (amenities)

---

## üß™ Testing Considerations

### Location Screen
- Test on real device (for GPS)
- Handle permission denials
- Validate coordinates are within Malaysia

### Documents Screen
- Test multiple image uploads
- Handle large file sizes
- Verify Supabase storage works

### Staff & Services
- Test add/remove functionality
- Validate minimum requirements
- Test form persistence

---

## üì¶ Expected File Sizes

Based on barber screens:
- Location: ~500 lines (map adds complexity)
- Documents: ~600 lines (multiple uploads)
- Operating Hours: ~400 lines
- Staff & Services: ~700 lines (most complex)
- Amenities: ~350 lines (simplest)
- Payout: ~420 lines (reuse barber)
- Review: ~600 lines

**Total estimated:** ~3,570 lines for 7 screens

---

## üéØ Which Approach?

**Recommend:** Option A - Generate all now

**Reasoning:**
1. Maintains consistency across all screens
2. Complete flow ready for testing
3. Similar patterns to barber (faster to generate)
4. You can test incrementally even if all exist

**Would you like me to:**
- ‚úÖ Generate all 7 remaining screens now?
- ‚è≥ Build them in phases?
- üéØ Start with most critical 3-4?

**Ready when you are!** Just say "generate all barbershop screens" and I'll create all 7 files.
