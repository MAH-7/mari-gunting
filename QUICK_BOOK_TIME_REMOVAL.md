# Quick Book - Time Selection Removal

## Change Summary

Removed the time selection section from the Quick Book screen since the app is designed for **ASAP-only bookings** (on-demand service).

---

## What Was Changed

### 1. Removed Time Slots Constant
**Before:**
```typescript
const TIME_SLOTS = [
  { id: 'now', label: 'Now', icon: 'flash' },
  { id: '15min', label: '15 min', icon: 'time-outline' },
  { id: '30min', label: '30 min', icon: 'time-outline' },
  { id: '1hour', label: '1 hour', icon: 'time-outline' },
];

const [selectedTime, setSelectedTime] = useState<string>('now');
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Removed - always use 'now' for ASAP bookings
```

### 2. Updated API Call
**Before:**
```typescript
quickBookMutation.mutate({
  time: selectedTime,
  radius,
  maxPrice,
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
quickBookMutation.mutate({
  time: 'now', // Always ASAP for Quick Book
  radius,
  maxPrice,
});
```

### 3. Removed "When" Section from UI
Removed the entire time selection UI section:
- Time slot buttons (Now, 15 min, 30 min, 1 hour)
- Section title and subtitle
- Selection state management

### 4. Updated Summary Card
**Before:**
```typescript
<View style={styles.summaryItem}>
  <Ionicons name="time-outline" size={24} color="#6B7280" />
  <Text style={styles.summaryLabel}>When</Text>
  <Text style={styles.summaryValue}>{timeSlotLabel}</Text>
</View>
```

**After:**
```typescript
<View style={styles.summaryItem}>
  <Ionicons name="flash-outline" size={24} color="#6B7280" />
  <Text style={styles.summaryLabel}>Service</Text>
  <Text style={styles.summaryValue}>ASAP</Text>
</View>
```

### 5. Removed Unused Styles
Cleaned up unused CSS:
- `timeRow`
- `timePill`
- `timePillActive`
- `timeIcon`
- `timeText`
- `timeTextActive`

## Rationale

### Why Remove Time Selection?

1. **On-Demand Service Model**
   - Mari Gunting is designed for immediate, on-demand service
   - Barbers come to customer locations ASAP
   - No scheduled appointments needed

2. **Simplified User Experience**
   - Reduces decision fatigue
   - Faster booking process
   - Clearer value proposition: "Get a barber now"

3. **Consistency with Confirm Booking**
   - The confirm booking screen shows "On-Demand Service" banner
   - Text states: "Your barber will arrive at your location as soon as possible"
   - No time selection is offered there either

4. **Business Model Alignment**
   - Quick Book = Instant service
   - Choose Barber = Browse + Instant service
   - Both flows are ASAP by design

---

## Quick Book Screen Now Shows

1. **Search Radius** - How far to look for barbers (1-20 km)
2. **Maximum Price** - Budget constraint (RM 10-200)
3. **Summary Card** - Shows:
   - Service: ASAP (replaces "When")
   - Radius: X km
   - Max Budget: RM X
   - Available: ~X barbers

---

## User Flow

### Before:
```
Quick Book Screen
├── Set Radius
├── Set Max Price
├── Choose Time (Now/15min/30min/1hr) ❌
└── Find Barber → Confirm Booking
```

### After:
```
Quick Book Screen
├── Set Radius
├── Set Max Price
└── Find Barber (Always ASAP) ✅ → Confirm Booking
```

✅ **Cleaner Code** - Removed unused state and styles

## Related Files Modified

- `app/quick-book.tsx` - Removed time selection UI and state
- No changes needed to API (already accepts 'now' as value)
- No changes needed to confirm booking screen

---

## Future Considerations

If scheduled bookings are needed in the future:
1. Add a separate "Schedule Booking" feature
2. Different from Quick Book (which stays ASAP)
3. Would show in Choose Barber → Barber Profile flow
4. Would require calendar/time picker on confirm screen

For now, the app maintains its core value proposition: **Instant, on-demand barber service**.
