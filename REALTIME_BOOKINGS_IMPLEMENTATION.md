# Real-Time Booking Subscriptions Implementation

## ✅ What We Implemented

### 1. Customer Booking Details Screen
**File:** `/apps/customer/app/booking/[id].tsx`

**Features:**
- ✅ Real-time subscription to specific booking changes
- ✅ Removed 30-second polling (now instant updates)
- ✅ Automatic UI refresh when booking status changes
- ✅ Smart notifications for status changes:
  - "Booking Accepted" when barber confirms
  - "Barber On The Way" when barber is traveling
  - "Service Started" when haircut begins
  - "Service Completed" when done
  - "Booking Cancelled" if cancelled

**Technical Details:**
```typescript
// Subscribes to specific booking
supabase.channel(`booking-${id}`)
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: 'UPDATE',
    table: 'bookings',
    filter: `id=eq.${id}`
  })
```

**Benefits:**
- ⚡ Instant updates (no lag)
- 📱 Better UX with timely notifications
- 🔋 Battery efficient (no polling)
- 📊 Always shows current status

### 2. Customer Bookings List Screen
**File:** `/apps/customer/app/(tabs)/bookings.tsx`

**Features:**
- ✅ Real-time subscription to all customer's bookings
- ✅ Listens to INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE events
- ✅ Automatic list refresh when changes occur
- ✅ Notification when new booking created
- ✅ Syncs with booking details screen

**Technical Details:**
```typescript
// Subscribes to all bookings for this customer
supabase.channel(`customer-bookings-${currentUser.id}`)
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: '*', // All events
    table: 'bookings',
    filter: `customer_id=eq.${currentUser.id}`
  })
```

**Benefits:**
- 📋 List always up-to-date
- 🔔 Know immediately when barber acts
- 🔄 No manual refresh needed
- 🎯 Filtered to user's bookings only

## 📝 Partner App Status

The partner app's booking screens (`/apps/partner/app/(tabs)/bookings.tsx` and `jobs.tsx`) are currently using **mock data**, not real Supabase data. 

**To add real-time subscriptions to partner app, you need to:**

1. **First:** Replace mock data with real Supabase queries
2. **Then:** Add similar real-time subscriptions like we did for customer app

**Example for partner:**
```typescript
// Partner would subscribe to bookings where they are the barber
supabase.channel(`partner-bookings-${barberId}`)
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: '*',
    table: 'bookings',
    filter: `barber_id=eq.${barberId}`
  })
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test Customer Booking Details Updates

1. **Open customer app** → Navigate to an active booking
2. **Open Supabase Dashboard** → Table Editor → `bookings`
3. **Update the booking status** (e.g., from "pending" to "accepted")
4. **Check customer app:**
   - ✅ Should show alert: "Booking Accepted"
   - ✅ Status should update immediately
   - ✅ UI should reflect new status

### Test Customer Bookings List Updates

1. **Open customer app** → Bookings tab
2. **Open Supabase Dashboard** → Create or update a booking
3. **Check customer app:**
   - ✅ List should refresh automatically
   - ✅ New/updated booking appears instantly

### Console Logs to Look For

```
🔌 Setting up real-time subscription for booking: [id]
📡 Booking subscription status: SUBSCRIBED
✅ Successfully subscribed to booking updates
🔔 Booking UPDATE received: [payload]
Status changed: pending → accepted
```

## 🔄 How It Works

### Architecture

```
Customer App (booking details)
    ↓
    Listens to: bookings table (id=eq.{bookingId})
    ↓
    ← Real-time event from Supabase
    ↓
    refetch() → Update UI → Show notification
```

### Event Flow

1. **Partner updates booking** (e.g., accepts it)
2. **Database changes** (bookings.status = 'accepted')
3. **Supabase broadcasts** real-time event
4. **Customer app receives** event via subscription
5. **App refetches** booking data
6. **UI updates** with new status
7. **Notification shown** to user

## 📊 Performance Impact

### Before (Polling)
- ⏰ Updates every 30 seconds
- 🔋 Constant network requests
- 📱 Battery drain
- ⏱️ 0-30 second delay

### After (Real-Time)
- ⚡ Instant updates (<1 second)
- 🔋 Only on actual changes
- 📱 Battery efficient
- ⏱️ Near-zero delay

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Recommended)
1. ✅ Test the customer app real-time updates
2. ✅ Verify console logs show subscriptions working
3. ✅ Test with multiple devices/simulators

### Future Enhancements
1. **Partner App Real-Time**
   - Replace mock data with real Supabase queries
   - Add real-time subscriptions for barber's bookings
   
2. **Location Tracking**
   - Real-time barber location updates
   - Show on map when "on-the-way"
   
3. **Chat Messages**
   - Real-time messaging between customer and barber
   
4. **Reviews & Ratings**
   - Instant notification when reviewed
   
5. **Earnings Dashboard**
   - Live earnings updates

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Subscription Not Working?

**Check:**
1. ✅ RLS policies allow reading bookings table
2. ✅ Supabase realtime is enabled on bookings table
3. ✅ Customer ID matches the logged-in user
4. ✅ Console shows "SUBSCRIBED" status

**Enable Realtime in Supabase Dashboard:**
1. Go to Database → Replication
2. Find `bookings` table
3. Enable realtime for all columns

### No Notifications Shown?

The notifications use `Alert.alert()` which:
- ✅ Works in both iOS and Android
- ⚠️ May be disabled if app is in background
- ⚠️ Only shows on actual status changes
