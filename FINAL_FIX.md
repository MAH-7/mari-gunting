# ✅ FINAL FIX - NativeWind v2 (Stable Version)

## What I Did

Switched from NativeWind v4 (unstable) to **NativeWind v2** (stable and proven).

### Changes:
1. ✅ Downgraded to NativeWind v2.0.11
2. ✅ Downgraded to Tailwind CSS 3.3.2
3. ✅ Removed metro.config.js (not needed in v2)
4. ✅ Removed global.css (not needed in v2)
5. ✅ Updated configurations

## 🚀 Run This Now!

```bash
# Clear everything
rm -rf .expo node_modules/.cache

# Start with clear cache
npm start -- --clear
```

**IMPORTANT:** Wait for the bundler to fully load, then:
- Press `r` in terminal to reload
- Or shake device → "Reload"

## 🎨 What You Should See

After reload:
- ✅ **Blue header** on all screens
- ✅ **White rounded cards**
- ✅ **Colored badges** (green, yellow, blue)
- ✅ **Proper spacing** everywhere

## 📱 Test These Screens

## ⚠️ If Still Not Working

Try the nuclear option:

# 1. Stop the server (Ctrl+C)

# 2. Delete everything
rm -rf node_modules
rm -rf .expo
rm -rf node_modules/.cache

# 3. Reinstall
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# 4. Start fresh
npm start -- --clear
```

## 🔍 Check Terminal Output

You should see:
```
Starting Metro Bundler

```

NO errors about:
- CSS processing
- NativeWind warnings
- Babel errors

## 💡 Why This Works

**NativeWind v2 vs v4:**
- ✅ v2: Stable, proven, works out of the box
- ❌ v4: New, requires complex setup, has compatibility issues with Expo SDK 54
