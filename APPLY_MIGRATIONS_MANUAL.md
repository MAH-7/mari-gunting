## ‚úÖ Verify Installation

### Check Functions Exist

Run this query in SQL Editor:
```sql
SELECT 
  routine_name,
  routine_type
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_schema = 'public'
  AND routine_name IN (
    'create_booking',
    'get_customer_bookings',
    'submit_review',
    'get_barber_reviews'
  )
ORDER BY routine_name;
```

**Expected**: Should return 4 rows showing these functions

### Check Tables Exist

```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  AND table_name = 'customer_addresses';
```

**Expected**: Should return 1 row

## üß™ Test the Functions

### Test 1: Create a Booking

First, get a customer ID and barber ID:
```sql
-- Get a customer user
SELECT id, full_name, role FROM profiles WHERE role = 'customer' LIMIT 1;

-- Get a barber
SELECT b.id, p.full_name 
FROM barbers b 
JOIN profiles p ON b.user_id = p.id 
LIMIT 1;
```

Then create a test booking (replace UUIDs with actual ones):
```sql
SELECT * FROM create_booking(
  'YOUR-CUSTOMER-UUID'::UUID,  -- Replace with actual customer ID
  'YOUR-BARBER-UUID'::UUID,     -- Replace with actual barber ID
  NULL,                         -- barbershop_id (null for freelance)
  '[{"name":"Haircut","price":30,"duration":60}]'::JSONB,
  CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '3 days',  -- 3 days from now
  '14:00'::TIME,
  'home_service',
  '{"line1":"123 Test St","city":"Kuala Lumpur"}'::JSONB,
  'Test booking from migration'
);
```

**Expected output**: 
- booking_id (UUID)
- booking_number (e.g., MG20250109001)
- total_price (37.00 = 30 service + 2 fee + 5 travel)
- message: "Booking created successfully"

### Test 2: Get Customer Bookings

```sql
SELECT 
  booking_number,
  status,
  barber_name,
  total_price,
  scheduled_date
FROM get_customer_bookings(
  'YOUR-CUSTOMER-UUID'::UUID,  -- Same customer ID
  NULL,  -- All statuses
  10,    -- Limit
  0      -- Offset
);
```

**Expected**: Should show the booking you just created

### Test 3: Submit a Review (After completing a booking)

First, update a booking to completed:
```sql
UPDATE bookings 
SET status = 'completed', 
    completed_at = NOW()
WHERE booking_number = 'MG20250109001';  -- Your booking number
```

Then submit a review:
```sql
SELECT * FROM submit_review(
  (SELECT id FROM bookings WHERE booking_number = 'MG20250109001'),  -- booking_id
  'YOUR-CUSTOMER-UUID'::UUID,  -- customer_id
  5,                           -- rating (5 stars)
  'Excellent service! Very professional.',
  NULL                         -- no images
);
```

**Expected output**:
- review_id (UUID)
- success: true
- message: "Review submitted successfully"

### Test 4: Check Barber Rating Updated

```sql
SELECT 
  b.id,
  p.full_name,
  b.rating,
  b.total_reviews
FROM barbers b
JOIN profiles p ON b.user_id = p.id
WHERE b.id = 'YOUR-BARBER-UUID'::UUID;
```

**Expected**: 
- rating should now show (e.g., 5.00)
- total_reviews should be 1 or more

## üéâ Success Criteria

Migrations are successfully applied when:

- [x] Both SQL files run without errors
- [x] 10 new functions appear in database
- [x] `customer_addresses` table exists
- [x] Test booking creation works
- [x] Test review submission works
- [x] Barber rating auto-updates

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Error: "function already exists"
**Solution**: That's okay! It means the function is already there. Just continue.

### Error: "relation does not exist"
**Solution**: Make sure you ran migration 005 before 006, as 006 depends on tables from 001 (initial schema).

### Error: "permission denied"
**Solution**: You need to be logged in as the project owner or have admin access.

### Connection timeout
**Solution**: Check your internet connection and try again. Supabase dashboard doesn't require special network setup.
