✅ Added "Track Barber Live" button to booking details
✅ Exported location parsing utility
✅ Created comprehensive documentation

---

## What You Need To Do (3 Steps):

### ✅ Step 1: Enable Supabase Realtime (1 minute)

**File created:** `supabase_enable_realtime.sql`

**Action:**
1. Open https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Go to your project
3. Click "SQL Editor" in sidebar
4. Open the file `supabase_enable_realtime.sql` from your project root
5. Copy and paste the SQL into the editor
6. Click "RUN"

**What it does:** Enables real-time updates for the profiles table so location changes are pushed to customers instantly.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Test the Feature (10 minutes)

**No code changes needed - the button is already added!**

**Testing steps:**

1. **Open both apps:**
   - Device A: Partner app (or run on physical iPhone)
   - Device B: Customer app (or run on simulator)

2. **Create a test booking:**
   - Use customer app to book a service
   - Use partner app to accept the booking

3. **Test tracking:**
   - On customer app, open the booking details
   - You'll see a purple "Track Barber Live" button
   - Tap it to open the tracking screen
   - Watch the map show both locations

4. **Move around:**
   - Walk with the partner device
   - Watch the customer app update in real-time
   - ETA should recalculate automatically

5. **Test arrival notification:**
   - Get within 100 meters
   - Should trigger sound, vibration, and notification

---

### ✅ Step 3: Add Sound File (Optional - 5 minutes)

**If you want a custom arrival sound:**

1. Download a notification sound (MP3, 1-3 seconds):
   - https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/
   - Search: "notification", "chime", or "bell"

2. Place the file here:
   ```
   apps/customer/assets/sounds/arrival.mp3
   ```

**If you skip this:** The feature will use system notification sound. Still works perfectly!

- ✅ Booking status is: `accepted`, `on-the-way`, or `in-progress`
- ✅ A barber is assigned to the booking

---

## Quick Test Command

```bash
# Run customer app
cd /Users/bos/Desktop/ProjectSideIncome/mari-gunting
npm run customer
```
