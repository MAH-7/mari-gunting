# üéØ Production-Grade Filter & Sort Logic - Barbershops Screen

## Overview
Implemented **Grab-style** filtering and sorting with production-ready UX patterns.

---

## üîç Filter Options

### 1. **Distance Filter** (Slider: 0-20 km)
- Uses geolocation distance from user
- Default: 20 km (show all)
- When < 20 km: filters shops beyond radius
- **Logic**: `shop.distance <= filters.distance`

### 2. **Price Range Filter** (Chip-based Selection)
Based on **starting/minimum price** (most relevant to users):

| Tier | Range | Logic |
|------|-------|-------|
| **All** | Any price | Show all shops |
| **Budget** (RM 10-20) | Entry-level | `minPrice >= 10 && minPrice <= 20` |
| **Mid-range** (RM 20-40) | Standard | `minPrice > 20 && minPrice <= 40` |
| **Premium** (RM 40+) | High-end | `minPrice > 40` |

**Why minimum price?**
- Users care most about the **starting price** ("From RM X")
- Matches user expectation: "Can I afford this shop?"
- More intuitive than average (which can be misleading)

### 3. **Quick Filters** (Toggle Switches)
- ‚úÖ **Open Now**: `shop.isOpen === true`
- ‚úÖ **Verified Only**: `shop.isVerified === true`

## üìä Sort Options

### 1. **Recommended** (Default)
Smart algorithm balancing multiple factors:
```typescript
score = (rating √ó 0.4) + (proximity √ó 0.3) + (popularity √ó 0.3)

where:
- rating = shop.rating (0-5 scale)
- proximity = (20 - distance) to favor closer shops
- popularity = bookingsCount / 100 for normalization
```

**Why this formula?**
- 40% rating: Quality is most important
- 30% distance: Convenience matters
- 30% bookings: Social proof/trust

### 2. **Nearest First**
Sort by: `shop.distance` (ascending)
- Shows closest shops first
- Best for "I need a cut NOW" scenarios

### 3. **Highest Rated**
Sort by: `shop.rating` (descending)
- Shows best-rated shops first
- Quality-focused users

### 4. **Lowest Price**
Sort by: `Math.min(...shop.services.prices)` (ascending)
- Shows budget options first
- Price-conscious users

## üé® UI/UX Design Patterns

### Filter Modal
- **Bottom sheet animation** with backdrop
- **Chip-based selection** for price & sort (modern, clean)
- **Clear visual feedback** (green active state)
- **Reset button** to clear all filters quickly
- **Apply button** to confirm changes

### Active Filter Indicator
- Green badge on filter icon
- Shows "X shops available" count
- "Clear filters" quick action when active

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Filter State
```typescript
interface FilterOptions {
  distance: number;                              // 0-20 km
  priceRange: 'all' | 'budget' | 'mid' | 'premium';
  openNow: boolean;
  verifiedOnly: boolean;
  sortBy: 'recommended' | 'distance' | 'rating' | 'price_low' | 'price_high';
}
```

### Filter Pipeline
```
1. Fetch all shops
   ‚Üì
2. Filter by distance
   ‚Üì
3. Filter by price range
   ‚Üì
4. Filter by open now
   ‚Üì
5. Filter by verified
   ‚Üì
6. Sort by selected option
   ‚Üì
7. Display results
```

### Performance Considerations
- ‚úÖ All filtering done client-side (fast)
- ‚úÖ Memoized calculations where possible
- ‚úÖ Efficient array operations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è For 1000+ shops, consider server-side filtering
