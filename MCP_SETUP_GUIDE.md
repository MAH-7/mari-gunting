## ðŸŽ¯ What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a system that helps AI assistants maintain persistent memory of your project, even across different chat sessions or when context limits are reached.

### Benefits
âœ… **Persistent Memory**: AI remembers your project structure  
âœ… **Context Recovery**: When hitting 100% context, AI can reload from files  
âœ… **Better Assistance**: More accurate suggestions based on project knowledge  
âœ… **Faster Development**: Less time explaining the same things

---

## ðŸ“‹ What We Created

### 1. Context Documentation Files
These files help AI understand your project:

- **`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`** - Main project overview
- **`DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md`** - Current progress tracker
- **`ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md`** - System design documentation
- **`COMMON_TASKS.md`** - Command reference guide

### 2. MCP Configuration
- **`.mcp/config.json`** - MCP server configuration
- Enables filesystem and git context access

### 3. Warp Rules
- **`.warp/rules/project-context.yaml`** - Warp-specific AI rules
- Helps Warp AI understand your project automatically

---

## ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Verify Files Created âœ…

All MCP files have been created! Verify they exist:

```bash
# Check context files (root directory)
ls -la PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
ls -la DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md
ls -la ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md
ls -la COMMON_TASKS.md

# Check MCP config
ls -la .mcp/config.json

# Check Warp rules
ls -la .warp/rules/project-context.yaml
```

Expected output: All files should exist with recent timestamps.

---

### Step 2: Enable MCP in Warp

#### Option A: Using Warp Settings (Recommended)

1. **Open Warp Settings**:
   - Press `Cmd + ,` (Command + Comma)
   - Or click Warp menu â†’ Settings

2. **Navigate to AI Settings**:
   - Look for "AI" or "Warp AI" section in sidebar
   - Click on it

3. **Enable MCP**:
   - Find "Model Context Protocol (MCP)" section
   - Toggle switch to **ON**
   - Look for "MCP Servers" or "Context Sources"

4. **Configure MCP Servers**:
   - Click "Add MCP Server" or "Configure"
   - Warp should auto-detect `.mcp/config.json`
   - If not, manually point to: `/Users/bos/Desktop/ProjectSideIncome/mari-gunting/.mcp/config.json`

5. **Enable Context Files**:
   - Look for "Context Files" or "Project Context" section
   - Ensure these files are marked for inclusion:
     - `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
     - `DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md`
     - `ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md`
     - `COMMON_TASKS.md`

6. **Save & Restart**:
   - Click "Save" or "Apply"
   - Restart Warp terminal

#### Option B: Using Warp Config File (Advanced)

If Warp doesn't have UI for MCP yet, you might need to edit config:

```bash
# Open Warp config (if it exists)
code ~/.warp/config.yaml

# Or check if there's a config directory
ls -la ~/.warp/
```

Add MCP configuration (adapt based on Warp's actual config format):

```yaml
# Example - actual format may differ
mcp:
  enabled: true
  config_path: /Users/bos/Desktop/ProjectSideIncome/mari-gunting/.mcp/config.json
  auto_load_context: true
```

---

### Step 3: Verify MCP is Working

Test if MCP is active:

1. **Start a New Chat in Warp**:
   - Open Warp AI panel
   - Type: "What project am I working on?"

2. **Expected Response**:
   AI should mention:
   - "Mari Gunting"
   - "Barber marketplace"
   - "Monorepo with Customer and Provider apps"
   - "50% complete"

3. **Test Context Recovery**:
   - Ask: "Where is the mock data located?"
   - AI should respond: `packages/shared/services/mockData.ts`

4. **Test Project Knowledge**:
   - Ask: "What's the next task I need to complete?"
   - AI should respond: "Provider Schedule Management (Week 5)"

---

### Step 4: Install MCP Server Packages (If Needed)

The `.mcp/config.json` uses npm packages. Ensure they're available:

```bash
# These will be installed automatically via npx
# But you can pre-install globally if preferred:

npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-git
```

**Note**: Using `npx` (as configured) will auto-install these on first use.

---

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Warp Doesn't Have MCP Settings

**Solution**: MCP support might be in beta or coming soon.

**Workarounds**:
1. **Manual Context Loading**:
   - When starting a new chat, paste this:
   ```
   Please read these context files:
   - PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
   - DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md
   ```

2. **Use Files as Reference**:
   - Keep context files open in VS Code
   - Refer to them when asking questions

3. **Wait for Warp Update**:
   - MCP is relatively new
   - Check Warp release notes for MCP support

---

### Issue 2: MCP Servers Not Running

**Check if servers are installed**:
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem --version
npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-git --version
```

**If errors occur**:
```bash
# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Try installing globally
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-git
```

---

### Issue 3: AI Still Doesn't Remember Context

**Possible causes**:
1. MCP not fully enabled in Warp
2. Context files not loaded
3. MCP servers not running

**Solutions**:
1. **Manually reference files**:
   ```
   "Before answering, please read PROJECT_CONTEXT.md"
   ```

2. **Provide key info upfront**:
   ```
   Context:
   - Project: Mari Gunting (barber marketplace)
   - Location: /Users/bos/Desktop/ProjectSideIncome/mari-gunting
   - Structure: Monorepo (apps/customer, apps/partner, packages/shared)
   - Status: Customer app 100%, Provider app 50%
   
   Question: [your question]
   ```

3. **Check Warp logs**:
   ```bash
   # Warp may have logs showing MCP status
   # Check: ~/.warp/logs/ or similar
   ```

---

### Issue 4: Context Still Reaches 100%

Even with MCP, very long conversations can hit limits.

**Solutions**:
1. **Start Fresh Session**:
   - MCP will reload context automatically
   - Previous knowledge persists via files

2. **Summarize Before Limit**:
   - Ask AI to summarize current work
   - Copy summary to DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md

3. **Use Focused Questions**:
   - Break large tasks into smaller questions
   - Reference specific files when asking

---

## ðŸ’¡ How to Use MCP Effectively

### Best Practices

#### 1. Update Context Files Regularly
```bash
# After completing major work, update status:
code DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md

# Add notes about what you did
# Update progress checkboxes
# Note any blockers or decisions
```

#### 2. Reference Files in Questions
```
"According to DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md, what's next?"
"Check COMMON_TASKS.md - how do I run the app?"
```

#### 3. Leverage Git Context
```
"What did I change in the last commit?"
"Show me git history for mockData.ts"
```

#### 4. Ask About Project Structure
```
"Where should I add a new shared component?"
"What's the difference between Customer and Provider apps?"
```
