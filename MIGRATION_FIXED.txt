✅ MIGRATION FILES FIXED!

The parameter order errors have been corrected in:
supabase/migrations/005_customer_booking_functions.sql

What was changed:
1. create_booking() - Moved optional parameters (barbershop_id, customer_address, customer_notes) to the end
2. add_customer_address() - Moved optional parameters (address_line2, postal_code, lat/lng) to the end

Now you can apply the migration by:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard (already open in browser)
2. Click "SQL Editor" 
3. Click "New query"
4. Copy the ENTIRE content of: supabase/migrations/005_customer_booking_functions.sql
5. Paste and click "Run"
6. Should see "Success. No rows returned"

Then repeat for:
supabase/migrations/006_review_system.sql

The files are now PostgreSQL-compliant! ✅
