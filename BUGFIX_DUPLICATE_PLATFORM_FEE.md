# Bug Fix: Duplicate Platform Fee in Total

## Issue üêõ

**Problem:** Booking detail total was showing RM 42 instead of RM 41

**Example:**
- Services: RM 35
- Travel Cost: RM 5
- Platform Fee: RM 1 (displayed)
- **Total: RM 42** ‚ùå (should be RM 41)

**Root Cause:** Platform fee was being added twice - once when creating the booking (in `totalPrice`), and again when displaying in the booking detail screen.

---

## Fix Applied ‚úÖ

**File:** `/app/booking/[id].tsx`  
**Line:** 554

**Changed from:**
```typescript
<Text style={styles.totalValue}>
  {formatCurrency((booking.totalPrice || booking.price || 0) + 1.00)}
</Text>
```

**Changed to:**
```typescript
<Text style={styles.totalValue}>
  {formatCurrency(booking.totalPrice || booking.price || 0)}
</Text>
```

**Why:** The `booking.totalPrice` already includes the platform fee (calculated during booking creation as `subtotal + travelCost + platformFee`), so we shouldn't add it again when displaying.

---

## Technical Details

### How Total is Calculated:

#### 1. During Booking Creation (Confirm Screen)
**File:** `/app/booking/create.tsx` (line 59)

```typescript
const total = Math.round((subtotal + travelCost + platformFee) * 100) / 100;
// Example: (35 + 5 + 1) = 41
```

This `total` becomes `booking.totalPrice` when stored.

#### 2. During Display (Booking Detail)
**File:** `/app/booking/[id].tsx` (line 554)

**Before Fix:**
```typescript
// WRONG: Adding platform fee again!
{formatCurrency((booking.totalPrice || booking.price || 0) + 1.00)}
// (41) + 1 = 42 ‚ùå
```

**After Fix:**
```typescript
// CORRECT: Use totalPrice as-is
{formatCurrency(booking.totalPrice || booking.price || 0)}
// 41 ‚úÖ
```

## Math Breakdown

### Correct Calculation:
```
Services:      RM 35
Travel Cost:   RM  5
Platform Fee:  RM  1
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
Total:         RM 41 ‚úÖ
```

### What Was Happening (Bug):
```
During Creation:
  totalPrice = 35 + 5 + 1 = 41

During Display:
  total = totalPrice + 1 = 41 + 1 = 42 ‚ùå
  (Platform fee added twice!)
```

## Files Modified

**`app/booking/[id].tsx`**
- Line 554: Removed `+ 1.00` from total calculation

## Testing

### To Verify Fix:

1. ‚úÖ Create a new booking
2. ‚úÖ Select services (e.g., Haircut RM 35)
3. ‚úÖ Confirm booking (should show total RM 41)
4. ‚úÖ Complete payment
5. ‚úÖ View booking detail
6. ‚úÖ **Verify pricing:**
   - Services: RM 35
   - Travel Cost: RM 5
   - Platform Fee: RM 1
   - **Total: RM 41** ‚úÖ (not RM 42)

---

## Context

This was a follow-up issue after implementing Phase 1 fixes where we:
1. Added platform fee display to booking detail
2. Updated total calculation

The mistake was adding `+ 1.00` to the total, not realizing that `booking.totalPrice` already included the platform fee from when the booking was created.
