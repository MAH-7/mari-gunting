# Mapbox Configuration Fixes Applied

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ All fixes completed

---

## Summary

All three issues identified in the Mapbox verification have been resolved. Both apps now have consistent Mapbox configuration.

---

## ‚úÖ Fix 1: Standardized SDK Versions

### Problem:
- Customer app was using Mapbox SDK version `10.19.0`
- Partner app was using Mapbox SDK version `11.0.0`
- Version mismatch could cause compatibility issues

### Solution:
Updated partner app `app.config.ts` to use the same version as customer app.

**File:** `apps/partner/app.config.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
RNMapboxMapsVersion: '11.0.0'
```

**After:**
```typescript
RNMapboxMapsVersion: '10.19.0' // Standardized with customer app
```

### Result:
‚úÖ Both apps now use SDK version `10.19.0`

---

## ‚úÖ Fix 2: Added Download Token Configuration

### Problem:
- Customer app had `MAPBOX_DOWNLOADS_TOKEN` configured
- Partner app was missing this token
- Token is needed for iOS SDK downloads in production builds

### Solution:
Added download token entry to partner app `.env` file with fallback in config.

**File 1:** `apps/partner/.env`

**Added:**
```env
# Mapbox Secret Token for iOS SDK Downloads (starts with sk.)
# Get this from: https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/ with DOWNLOADS:READ scope
# Copy from customer app or generate new one with same scopes
MAPBOX_DOWNLOADS_TOKEN=
```

**File 2:** `apps/partner/app.config.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
RNMapboxMapsDownloadToken: process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN,
```

**After:**
```typescript
RNMapboxMapsDownloadToken: process.env.MAPBOX_DOWNLOADS_TOKEN || process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN,
```

### Result:
‚úÖ Partner app now has download token configuration with fallback
‚úÖ User needs to fill in the actual token value (instructions provided)

---

## ‚úÖ Fix 3: Added Clarifying Comments

### Problem:
- iOS/Android configs used `googleMapsApiKey` and `googleMaps` naming
- These configs actually contain Mapbox tokens
- Naming was confusing and could mislead developers

### Solution:
Added explanatory comments to both apps' config files.

**Files Updated:**
- `apps/customer/app.config.ts`
- `apps/partner/app.config.ts`

**Customer App - iOS Config (Line 37):**
```typescript
config: {
  // Note: Using Mapbox, but keeping legacy iOS config structure
  googleMapsApiKey: process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN,
}
```

**Customer App - Android Config (Line 60):**
```typescript
config: {
  // Note: Using Mapbox, but keeping legacy Android config structure
  googleMaps: {
    apiKey: process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN,
  }
}
```

**Partner App:** Same comments added at corresponding lines

### Result:
‚úÖ Future developers will understand the legacy naming
‚úÖ Configuration remains functional while being documented

## üìã Files Modified

1. ‚úÖ `apps/partner/app.config.ts`
   - Standardized SDK version to 10.19.0
   - Added download token fallback
   - Added clarifying comments (iOS & Android)

2. ‚úÖ `apps/partner/.env`
   - Added MAPBOX_DOWNLOADS_TOKEN entry with instructions

3. ‚úÖ `apps/customer/app.config.ts`
   - Added clarifying comments (iOS & Android)

---

## üéØ Current Status

### Both Apps Now Have:
- ‚úÖ Same Mapbox SDK version (10.19.0)
- ‚úÖ Consistent download token configuration
- ‚úÖ Clear documentation of config structure
- ‚úÖ Proper fallback mechanisms
- ‚úÖ Initialization code in place

### Configuration Consistency:
```
Customer App          Partner App
‚îú‚îÄ SDK: 10.19.0      ‚îú‚îÄ SDK: 10.19.0      ‚úÖ MATCH
‚îú‚îÄ Token: ‚úì          ‚îú‚îÄ Token: ‚úì          ‚úÖ MATCH
‚îú‚îÄ Download: ‚úì       ‚îú‚îÄ Download: ‚úì       ‚úÖ MATCH
‚îú‚îÄ Init: ‚úì           ‚îú‚îÄ Init: ‚úì           ‚úÖ MATCH
‚îî‚îÄ Comments: ‚úì       ‚îî‚îÄ Comments: ‚úì       ‚úÖ MATCH
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Action Required

### For Partner App:
The user needs to add the actual download token value to `apps/partner/.env`:

1. **Option 1:** Copy from customer app
   ```bash
   # Get token from customer app
   grep MAPBOX_DOWNLOADS_TOKEN apps/customer/.env
   
   # Add to partner app .env
   # MAPBOX_DOWNLOADS_TOKEN=sk.xxxxx
   ```

2. **Option 2:** Generate new token
   - Go to https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/
   - Create new secret token with `DOWNLOADS:READ` scope
   - Add to `apps/partner/.env`

**Note:** The config will work without this token (uses access token as fallback), but it's recommended for production builds.
