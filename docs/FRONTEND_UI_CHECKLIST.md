// Change to: Skip role selection, default to customer
```

**Decision Needed:**
- [ ] Remove barber option completely
- [ ] Keep but add "Coming Soon" badge
- [ ] Keep as-is (will confuse barber users)

**Recommended:** Remove for now

**If YES (build now):** Need to create:

- [ ] Provider profile
- [ ] Availability management

**If NO (build later):**
- [x] Just focus on customer UI

**Recommended:** Build later (after validating customer demand)
