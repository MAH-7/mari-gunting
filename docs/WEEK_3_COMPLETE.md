## 📊 **Technical Implementation**

### **State Management**
- `useState` for filters, search, selected job
- `useMemo` for performance optimization
- Filters bookings by provider ID
- Real-time filtering and searching

### **Data Filtering**
Smart filtering system:
- Filter by status groups
- Search by customer name
- Search by service name
- Sort by creation date (newest first)
- Real-time count updates

### **Filter Logic**
```typescript
- All: Show all provider jobs
- Pending: status === 'pending'
- Active: status in ['accepted', 'on-the-way', 'in-progress']
- Completed: status in ['completed', 'cancelled']
```

### **Search Logic**
- Case-insensitive matching
- Matches customer name
- Matches service names
- Live updates as you type

### **Performance**
- `useMemo` for filtered jobs
- `useMemo` for filter counts
- Efficient re-renders
- Smooth scrolling

### **UI/UX Features**
✅ Pull-to-refresh  
✅ Loading states  
✅ Empty states (2 types)  
✅ Search with clear button  
✅ Modal navigation  
✅ Status-based colors  
✅ Confirmation dialogs  
✅ Real-time count badges

2. Tap "Jobs" tab
3. Try different filters
4. Use search bar
5. Tap any job card to see details
6. Test action buttons:
   - Accept pending jobs

7. Try pull-to-refresh

**Note:** Currently shows jobs where `currentUser.id` matches `barberId` in mockBookings. Make sure logged-in user matches a barber to see data.

## 🐛 **Known Limitations** (To Address Later)

1. **No backend integration** - Actions don't actually update data yet
2. **No maps integration** - Location shows address only
3. **No phone call** - Call button doesn't dial yet
4. **No pagination** - Loads all jobs at once
5. **No real-time updates** - Need to manually refresh

These will be addressed in:
- Week 4: Advanced job workflow
- Backend phase: Real data persistence
- Polish phase: Maps, calls, notifications

---

**Next Action:** Ready to start Week 4 - Advanced Job Features! 🚀

Or proceed with:
- Week 5: Schedule & Availability
- Week 6: Earnings & Payouts
- Week 7: Customers & Profile
