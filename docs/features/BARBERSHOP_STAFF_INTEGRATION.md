# Barbershop Staff Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated **BarbershopStaff** mock data to create a clear separation between:
- **Freelance barbers** (mobile service - they travel to customers)
- **Barbershop staff** (fixed location - customers visit the shop)

## Changes Made

### 1. Mock Data (`services/mockData.ts`)
✅ **Added 11 barbershop staff members** across 6 different shops:

#### Shop 1: Kedai Gunting Rambut Ali (Budget Local Shop)
- **Rahim Abdullah** (KGA-001) - Senior barber, traditional cuts
- **Ismail Hassan** (KGA-002) - Quick service, basic cuts

#### Shop 2: The Gentleman Barber (Premium Mall Shop)
- **Vincent Lee** (TGB-001) - Master barber, London trained, 4.9★
- **Adrian Tan** (TGB-002) - Modern fades specialist

#### Shop 3: Salon Lelaki Kasual (Casual Salon)
- **Zul Azman** (SLK-001) - Casual cuts, friendly service

#### Shop 4: Barbershop Mat Rock (Traditional Shop)
- **Mat Rock** (BMR-001) - Owner, fast traditional service
- **Kamarul Izwan** (BMR-002) - Junior apprentice

#### Shop 7: Executive Grooming Lounge (Premium KLCC)

### 2. API Service (`services/api.ts`)
✅ **Updated `getBarbersByShopId`**:
- Now returns `BarbershopStaff` filtered by `barbershopId`
- No longer returns generic freelance barbers

✅ **Updated `getBarberById`**:
- Checks freelance barbers first
- Falls back to barbershop staff
- Returns staff member with all shop context

✅ **Added `mockServices` import** for proper typing

### 3. UI Component (`app/barbershop/barbers/[shopId].tsx`)
✅ **Updated to handle BarbershopStaff type**:
- Changed from `Barber` to `BarbershopStaff` type
- Replaced `isOnline` → `isAvailable` (since staff work at fixed location)
- Updated status badge: "Available Now" → "Available Today"
- Properly displays staff specializations and ratings

## Key Differences: Freelance vs Shop Staff

### Freelance Barbers (`mockBarbers`)
- IDs: `b1`, `b2`, `b3`, `b4`
- Names: Amir Hafiz, Faiz Rahman, Azman Ibrahim, Danish Lee
- Has: `location`, `distance`, `isOnline`
- Service: Mobile (travels to customer)
- Booking: Home/office visits

### Barbershop Staff (`mockBarbershopStaff`)
- IDs: `staff1` - `staff11`
- Has: `barbershopId`, `employeeNumber`, `workSchedule`
- Has: `isAvailable` (not `isOnline`)
- NO: `location`, `distance` fields
- Service: Fixed shop location
- Booking: Customer visits shop
