# Promo Code Removal from Booking Screen

## Date
6 October 2025

## Issue
Duplicate discount functionality - users had both:
1. **Promo Code input** at booking confirmation screen
2. **Voucher selection** at payment screen

This was confusing and redundant.

## Solution
**Removed promo code functionality** from booking confirmation screen, keeping only vouchers at payment screen.

## Rationale

### Why Keep Vouchers at Payment (Not Promo Codes at Booking)?

✅ **Better UX:**
- User sees complete price breakdown (services + travel + platform fee)
- Discount applied at the right moment (checkout)
- Clear savings message: "You save RM X!"

✅ **Cleaner Flow:**
- One place for discounts = less confusion
- Payment screen is the natural place for final pricing
- Follows industry standards (e-commerce checkout pattern)

✅ **Better for Business:**
- Higher conversion - discount at checkout is more impactful
- Reduces cart abandonment
- Clear call-to-action after discount applied

## Changes Made

### File: `app/booking/create.tsx`

**Removed:**
1. ❌ Promo code state variables:
   - `promoCode` 
   - `promoDiscount`

2. ❌ Promo code handler:
   - `handleApplyPromo()` function

3. ❌ Promo code UI section:
   - Input field with "Enter promo code"
   - Apply button
   - Success message

4. ❌ Discount row in price breakdown

5. ❌ Promo-related styles:
   - `promoContainer`
   - `promoInputContainer`
   - `promoInput`
   - `applyButton`
   - `applyButtonText`
   - `promoSuccess`
   - `promoSuccessText`
   - `discountLabel`
   - `discountValue`

6. ❌ Promo params passed to payment screen

**Kept:**
- ✅ All service selection
- ✅ Address selection
- ✅ Special requests notes
- ✅ Price breakdown (subtotal, travel, platform fee)
- ✅ Total calculation

## New User Flow

### Before (Confusing):
```
1. Booking Screen → Enter promo code "SAVE5"
2. See discount applied
3. Payment Screen → Select voucher "RM 5 OFF"
4. See another discount applied
   ❓ Which discount is used?
   ❓ Can I use both?
```

### After (Clear):
```
1. Booking Screen → Select services & address
2. See price breakdown (no discounts yet)
3. Payment Screen → Select voucher "RM 5 OFF"
4. See final total with discount
   ✓ Clear: "You save RM 5.00!"
   ✓ One discount applied
```

## Price Calculation

### Before:
```typescript
// At booking screen
const totalBeforeDiscount = subtotal + travelCost + platformFee;
const total = totalBeforeDiscount - promoDiscount; // Promo applied

// At payment screen
const total = params.amount; // Already discounted
const discount = calculateVoucherDiscount(); // Another discount?
```

### After:
```typescript
// At booking screen
const total = subtotal + travelCost + platformFee; // No discounts

// At payment screen (ONLY place for discounts)
const subtotal = params.subtotal;
const discount = calculateVoucherDiscount(); // Voucher discount
const total = subtotal + travelCost + platformFee - discount; // Clean
```

## Benefits

### For Users:
- 🎯 **Less confusion** - one discount system
- 💰 **Clear savings** - see exactly how much saved
- ⚡ **Faster checkout** - no need to hunt for promo codes
- 🎁 **Better rewards** - earned vouchers feel more valuable

### For Business:
- 📊 **Better tracking** - all discounts in one place
- 🎮 **Gamification** - vouchers drive engagement
- 💵 **Higher conversion** - checkout discounts work better
- 🔒 **More control** - vouchers can't be shared like promo codes

## Future: Promo Codes vs Vouchers

If you still want promo codes for marketing campaigns, here's the distinction:

### Vouchers (Existing ✅)
- **Earned through points** redemption
- Tied to user account
- Cannot be shared
- Personal reward system
- Example: "RM 5 OFF - Min spend RM 30"

### Promo Codes (Future 🔮)
- **Given by marketing** team
- Can be shared publicly
- One-time or limited use
- Promotional campaigns
- Example: "LAUNCH50 - 50% off first booking"

**If adding promo codes back:**
- Keep them ONLY at payment screen
- Apply before voucher selection
- Validate with backend API
- Track usage limits

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Price calculation correct (no double discounts)
- [x] Total passed to payment screen is pre-discount

## Conclusion

Simplified discount system by removing duplicate promo code functionality. Users now have one clear place to apply discounts (vouchers at payment), improving UX and conversion rates.

**Result:** Cleaner flow + Better UX + Higher conversion 🎉
