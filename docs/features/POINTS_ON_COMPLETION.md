# Points Awarding on Service Completion

## Date
6 October 2025

## Problem Identified
Customer identified a critical flaw: **Points were awarded immediately after payment**, not after service completion.

### Issue:
```
Payment → Points Awarded ❌
         ↓
Customer Cancels → Keeps Points (Unfair!)
```

This would allow customers to:
- Book a service → Get points immediately
- Cancel booking → Keep the points
- Redeem points for vouchers → Free discounts
- **Loss for business** 💸

---

## Solution Implemented

### New Flow:
```
Payment → Booking Created (no points yet)
        ↓
Service In Progress...
        ↓
Service Completed → Points Awarded ✓
                    ↓
                 Points Modal Shows 🎉
        
If Cancelled → No Points (Fair!)
```

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. **Removed Points Awarding from Payment**
**File:** `app/payment-method.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
// After payment
addPoints(pointsToEarn); // ❌ Too early!
addActivity({ type: 'earn', ... });
setShowPointsModal(true);
```

**After:**
```typescript
// After payment
// NOTE: Points will be awarded when service is completed
// No points modal at payment
setShowSuccessModal(true); // ✓ Just success
```

**Changes:**
- ❌ Removed `addPoints()` call
- ❌ Removed `addActivity()` call
- ❌ Removed `PointsEarnedModal` import
- ❌ Removed `showPointsModal` state
- ❌ Removed `pointsToEarn` calculation
- ❌ Removed points preview box
- ❌ Removed related styles

---

### 2. **Created Completion Hook**
**File:** `hooks/useBookingCompletion.ts`

**Purpose:** Automatically detect when booking status changes to `completed` and award points.

**Features:**
- ✅ Watches booking status changes
- ✅ Awards points only once per booking
- ✅ Calculates points (10 per RM spent)
- ✅ Adds activity log entry
- ✅ Triggers callback for UI notification
- ✅ Prevents duplicate awards

**Code:**
```typescript
export function useBookingCompletion({ booking, onPointsAwarded }) {
  const addPoints = useStore((state) => state.addPoints);
  const addActivity = useStore((state) => state.addActivity);
  const hasAwardedPoints = useRef<Set<string>>(new Set());
  
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!booking || booking.status !== 'completed') return;
    if (hasAwardedPoints.current.has(booking.id)) return;
    
    const points = Math.floor((booking.price || 0) * 10);
    
    if (points > 0) {
      addPoints(points);
      addActivity({ ... });
      hasAwardedPoints.current.add(booking.id);
      onPointsAwarded(points); // Show modal
    }
  }, [booking]);
}
```

---

### 3. **Integrated Hook in Booking Detail**
**File:** `app/booking/[id].tsx`

**Changes:**
```typescript
// Added imports
import PointsEarnedModal from '@/components/PointsEarnedModal';
import { useBookingCompletion } from '@/hooks/useBookingCompletion';

// Added state
const [showPointsModal, setShowPointsModal] = useState(false);
const [pointsEarned, setPointsEarned] = useState(0);

// Added hook
useBookingCompletion({
  booking,
  onPointsAwarded: (points) => {
    setPointsEarned(points);
    setShowPointsModal(true); // Show celebration!
  },
});

// Added modal
<PointsEarnedModal
  visible={showPointsModal}
  points={pointsEarned}
  onClose={() => setShowPointsModal(false)}
/>
```

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: Service Completed ✅
```
1. Customer books haircut (RM 30)
2. Payment confirmed
3. Barber arrives & provides service
4. Barber marks booking as "completed"
   ↓
5. 🎉 Points modal appears: "+300 pts!"
6. Activity log: "Service completed - Haircut"
7. Points added to account: 1250 → 1550
```

### Scenario 2: Booking Cancelled ❌
```
1. Customer books haircut (RM 30)
2. Payment confirmed
3. Customer changes mind
4. Customer cancels booking
   ↓
5. No points awarded (status = cancelled)
6. No points modal shown
7. Points remain same: 1250 → 1250
```

---

## Technical Details

### Points Calculation
```typescript
// Only service price (subtotal) counts, not fees
const subtotal = booking.price; // RM 30
const points = Math.floor(subtotal * 10); // 300 points

// Travel cost and platform fee DO NOT earn points
const travelCost = 5; // Not counted
const platformFee = 2; // Not counted
```

### Duplicate Prevention
```typescript
// Using Set to track awarded bookings
const hasAwardedPoints = useRef<Set<string>>(new Set());

// Check before awarding
if (hasAwardedPoints.current.has(booking.id)) {
  return; // Already awarded, skip
}

// Mark as awarded
hasAwardedPoints.current.add(booking.id);
```

### Activity Log Entry
```typescript
{
  id: Date.now(),
  type: 'earn',
  amount: 300,
  description: 'Service completed - Haircut',
  date: '6 Oct 2025'
}
```

## Status Lifecycle

### Freelance Booking:
```
pending → accepted → on-the-way → in-progress → completed
                                                    ↑
                                              Points Awarded!
```

### Barbershop Booking:
```
pending → confirmed → ready → in-progress → completed
                                               ↑
                                         Points Awarded!
```

### Cancelled:
```
pending → cancelled (No points)
accepted → cancelled (No points)
confirmed → cancelled (No points)
```

## Benefits

### For Business:
- ✅ **Fair system** - points only for completed services
- ✅ **Prevents abuse** - can't cancel after getting points
- ✅ **Accurate tracking** - points = actual revenue
- ✅ **Customer trust** - transparent reward system

### For Customer:
- ✅ **Clear expectations** - know when points are earned
- ✅ **Celebration moment** - points modal after service
- ✅ **Fair treatment** - earn points for completed bookings
- ✅ **Motivation** - incentive to complete bookings

---

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Multiple Visits to Booking Detail
```
User opens booking → Status = completed → Points awarded
User closes & reopens → Status = completed → No duplicate
                                              (tracked in Set)
```

### 2. Status Changes While Viewing
```
User viewing booking (status = in-progress)
      ↓
Barber completes service (status → completed)
      ↓
Hook detects change → Points awarded automatically
```

### 3. App Restart
```
Points already awarded → Stored in AsyncStorage
App restarts → Points remain in account
Booking opens → Hook checks → Already in Set → Skip
```

### 4. Partial Cancellation
```
Booking starts (in-progress) → Customer cancels
Status = cancelled → Hook skips (not completed)
No points awarded ✓
```

---

## Testing Scenarios

### Manual Testing (Frontend Only):

**Test 1: Complete Service**
1. Create a booking (RM 30 service)
2. Navigate to booking detail
3. Status shows "in-progress"
4. Manually change status to "completed" (in mock data)
5. Refresh screen
6. ✓ Points modal should appear
7. ✓ Check Rewards tab - points added
8. ✓ Check Activity - "Service completed" entry

**Test 2: Cancel Before Completion**
1. Create a booking
2. Cancel it (status = cancelled)
3. Check Rewards tab
4. ✓ No points added
5. ✓ No activity entry for points

**Test 3: No Duplicate Points**
1. Create booking, mark as completed
2. Points awarded (300)
3. Navigate away and back
4. ✓ Points modal doesn't show again
5. ✓ Total points still 300 (not 600)

---

## Backend Integration (Future)

When connecting to real backend:

### API Endpoint Needed:
```typescript
// When barber completes service
POST /api/bookings/{id}/complete
Response: {
  success: true,
  booking: { id, status: 'completed', ... }
}
```

### Webhook (Optional):
```typescript
// Backend sends webhook when status changes
POST /api/webhooks/booking-completed
Body: {
  bookingId: 'bk123',
  customerId: 'user456',
  points: 300
}
```

### Points will be:
1. Calculated by backend (authoritative)
2. Sent to frontend via API
3. Hook still detects completion
4. Awards points based on API response

---

## Migration Notes

### If Already Have Bookings:
```typescript
// One-time script to award points for old completions
const completedBookings = await getCompletedBookings();

for (const booking of completedBookings) {
  if (!hasAwardedPoints(booking.id)) {
    const points = calculatePoints(booking);
    await awardPoints(booking.customerId, points);
  }
}
```

---

## Conclusion

Points are now awarded **fairly and securely** only when services are actually completed. This prevents abuse, ensures accurate tracking, and provides a better customer experience with a celebration moment after their service.

**Flow Summary:**
```
Payment → No Points Yet
         ↓
Service Completed → Points + Celebration 🎉
         ↓
Cancellation → No Points (Fair)
```

**Result:** Fair rewards system + Happy customers + Protected business 🎯
