# Travel Cost Feature

## Overview
Added travel cost functionality to the booking system. Travel cost is automatically calculated based on distance and displayed in the booking details.

## Changes Made

### 1. Type Updates (`types/index.ts`)
- Added `distance?: number` - Distance in kilometers
- Added `travelCost?: number` - Auto-calculated travel cost

### 2. Booking Detail Page (`app/booking/[id].tsx`)
- Updated "Services" section to "Price Details"
- Added "Services" subsection label
- Added travel cost line item with car icon
- Shows distance (e.g., "3.5 km") under travel cost
- Only displays if `travelCost > 0`

### 3. Mock Data (`services/mockData.ts`)
- Added sample travel costs to all mock bookings:
  - Booking 1: Services RM 60 + Travel RM 10 = **Total RM 70**
  - Booking 2: Services RM 40 + Travel RM 15 = **Total RM 55**
  - Booking 3: Services RM 35 + Travel RM 8 = **Total RM 43**

Total                        RM 70
```

## Backend Integration (TODO)

When integrating with backend:

1. **Distance Calculation**
   - Use Google Maps Distance Matrix API or similar
   - Calculate from barber's location to customer's address

2. **Travel Cost Formula**
   - Example: `travelCost = distance * ratePerKm`
   - Rate per km can be configured in backend settings
   - Consider minimum charge for short distances

3. **API Response**
   ```typescript
   {
     "booking": {
       "id": "bk1",
       "services": [...],
       "distance": 3.5,          // in km
       "travelCost": 10,         // in RM
       "totalPrice": 70,         // services + travelCost
       ...
     }
   }
   ```

## Notes
- Travel cost is optional (won't display if not provided)
- UI automatically handles cases where `travelCost` is 0 or undefined
- Total price already includes travel cost in mock data
