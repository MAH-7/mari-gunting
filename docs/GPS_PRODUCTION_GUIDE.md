# GPS Location - Production Implementation Guide

## ✅ Production-Ready Features

### 1. **Timeout Protection**
```typescript
getCurrentPositionAsync({
  timeout: 15000, // Prevents app hanging
})
```
- App won't freeze if GPS takes too long
- Fallback to error after 15 seconds

### 2. **Location Caching**
```typescript
maximumAge: 10000, // Use location up to 10s old
```
- Reduces battery drain
- Faster response time
- Less GPS queries

### 3. **Accuracy Validation**
```typescript
MAX_ACCEPTABLE_ACCURACY_METERS = 500
```
- Warns if GPS accuracy > 500m
- Still returns location but logs warning
- Helps debug poor GPS signal issues

### 4. **Staleness Detection**
```typescript
LOCATION_FRESHNESS_MS = 60000 // 1 minute
```
- Tracks when location was last updated
- Auto-refreshes stale locations
- Prevents using outdated locations

### 5. **Battery Optimization**
```typescript
watchPositionAsync({
  timeInterval: 30000,      // Every 30s (not 10s)
  distanceInterval: 100,    // Every 100m (not 50m)
})
```
- Balanced accuracy vs battery life
- Suitable for most use cases

## 🔒 **Permission Handling (Production-Grade)**

### States Handled:
✅ Not determined  
✅ Denied  
✅ Granted  
✅ Can't ask again (goes to settings)  
✅ GPS disabled  

### User Experience:
- Clear explanations why GPS is needed
- Direct link to Settings
- Graceful degradation if denied

## 📊 **Location Update Strategy**

### When Location is Fetched:
1. **App Launch** → Get location
2. **Screen Opens** → Check freshness, refresh if needed
3. **App Resume** → Auto-refresh if stale
4. **User Moves** → Background watching (if enabled)

### Freshness Rules:
- **Fresh**: < 1 minute old → Use cached
- **Stale**: > 1 minute old → Fetch new
- **Very Stale**: > 5 minutes old → Force refresh

---

## 🎯 **Production Metrics to Monitor**

### 1. GPS Accuracy Distribution
```
< 20m:  Excellent (90% target)
< 50m:  Good     (95% target)
< 100m: Fair     (98% target)
> 500m: Poor     (< 2% acceptable)
```

### 2. GPS Fetch Time
```
< 2s:   Fast  (80% target)
< 5s:   Normal (95% target)
< 15s:  Slow   (98% target)
Timeout: 15s   (< 2% acceptable)
```

### 3. Battery Impact
```
Target: < 5% battery per hour
Monitor: Location update frequency
Optimize: Reduce frequency if battery < 20%
```

## 🚨 **Error Scenarios & Handling**

### 1. Permission Denied
```typescript
Action: Show alert → Open Settings
Fallback: Allow manual address entry
UX: "We need GPS to find barbers near you"
```

### 2. GPS Disabled
```typescript
Action: Show alert → Open Settings
Fallback: Use last known location
UX: "Please enable Location Services"
```

### 3. Timeout
```typescript
Action: Retry once, then use cached
Fallback: Show "GPS unavailable" + manual entry
UX: "Having trouble finding your location"
```

### 4. Poor Accuracy (> 500m)
```typescript
Action: Log warning, still use location
Fallback: Show accuracy indicator to user
UX: "Location accuracy: ±500m"
```

### 5. No GPS Hardware
```typescript
Action: Detect and fallback immediately
Fallback: Manual address selection only
UX: "Manual location selection"
```

## 💡 **Best Practices (Applied)**

### ✅ DO:
1. **Cache locations** (reduces battery)
2. **Set timeouts** (prevents hanging)
3. **Validate accuracy** (warn on poor GPS)
4. **Check freshness** (avoid stale data)
5. **Optimize intervals** (battery vs accuracy)
6. **Handle errors gracefully** (always have fallback)

### ❌ DON'T:
1. Don't fetch GPS every second (battery drain)
2. Don't hang UI waiting for GPS (use timeout)
3. Don't use very old locations (> 5 min stale)
4. Don't ignore accuracy (validate quality)
5. Don't assume GPS always works (have fallback)

## 📱 **iOS-Specific Considerations**

### Privacy String (Info.plist)
```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>Mari Gunting needs your location to find nearby barbers and calculate accurate travel costs.</string>
```

### Background Location (Future)
```xml
<key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>Track barber location during active bookings</string>

<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
  <string>location</string>
</array>
```

## 🧪 **Testing Checklist**

### Functional Tests:
- [ ] GPS permission granted → Works
- [ ] GPS permission denied → Fallback works
- [ ] GPS disabled → Alert shown
- [ ] Poor GPS signal → Still works with warning
- [ ] App in background → Refreshes on resume
- [ ] Location cached → Uses cache when fresh
- [ ] Timeout reached → Error handled gracefully

### Performance Tests:
- [ ] GPS fetch time < 5s (95% of requests)
- [ ] Battery drain < 5% per hour
- [ ] Location accuracy < 50m (90% of locations)
- [ ] App doesn't freeze waiting for GPS

### Edge Cases:
- [ ] Underground/no signal → Fallback works
- [ ] Airplane mode → Handled gracefully
- [ ] VPN/Mock location → Still works
- [ ] Rapid location changes → Updates correctly

   - "Searching for better signal..."

3. **Smart Caching**
   - Cache per-screen (different freshness rules)
   - Aggressive cache for static screens

### Priority 2 (Future):
1. **Background Location Tracking**
   - Track barber during active booking
   - Send ETA updates to customer

2. **Geofencing**
