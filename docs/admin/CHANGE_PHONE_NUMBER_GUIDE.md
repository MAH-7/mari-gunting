# üì± Admin Guide: How to Change Customer Phone Number

## üö® Common Issues

### Issue 1: New number already in use

**Error:**
```
SELECT returns rows for new phone number
```

**Solution:**
- Customer must choose different number
- Or resolve duplicate account issue

---

### Issue 2: User not found

**Error:**
```
SELECT returns 0 rows for old phone number
```

**Solution:**
- Check phone number format (+60 prefix?)
- Verify customer is in system
- Check if they used different number to register

---

### Issue 3: Auth update fails

**Error:**
```
Cannot update auth.users
```

**Solution:**
- Try again in Dashboard
- Clear browser cache
- Check service role permissions

---

## üîÑ Rollback Process

If something goes wrong:

```sql
-- 1. Restore from backup
UPDATE profiles
SET 
  phone_number = (SELECT phone_number FROM phone_change_backup),
  updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM phone_change_backup);

-- 2. Verify rollback
SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE id = '[USER_ID]';
```

Then revert in Dashboard:
1. Authentication ‚Üí Users
2. Find user
3. Change phone back to old number
4. Save

---

## üìä Audit Log

All changes are logged in `admin_audit_log` table:

```sql
-- View recent phone changes
SELECT 
  action,
  admin_user,
  old_value as old_phone,
  new_value as new_phone,
  reason,
  created_at
FROM admin_audit_log
WHERE action = 'PHONE_CHANGE'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

---

## üîí Security Best Practices

### DO ‚úÖ

- ‚úÖ Verify customer identity thoroughly
- ‚úÖ Create backup before changes
- ‚úÖ Log all changes with reason
- ‚úÖ Test new number works
- ‚úÖ Inform customer of change

### DON'T ‚ùå

- ‚ùå Change numbers without verification
- ‚ùå Skip backup step
- ‚ùå Forget to update auth system
- ‚ùå Give phone change access to junior staff
- ‚ùå Change multiple numbers at once

---

## üìû Support Escalation

**When to escalate:**
- Multiple phone change requests from same user
- Suspicious activity (fraud attempt)
- Technical issues with update
- Customer claims unauthorized change

**Contact:**
- Tech Lead: [YOUR_EMAIL]
- Security Team: [SECURITY_EMAIL]

---

## üìà Frequency Guidelines

**Normal:**
- 1-2 changes per user per year

**Suspicious:**
- 3+ changes in 6 months
- Changes immediately after registration
- Multiple users with same old/new numbers

**Action:**
- Flag for review
- Request additional verification
- Consider fraud investigation

---

## üîß First Time Setup

### Create Audit Log Table

Run this **once** in SQL Editor:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS admin_audit_log (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  action TEXT NOT NULL,
  admin_user TEXT NOT NULL,
  affected_user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  old_value TEXT,
  new_value TEXT,
  reason TEXT,
  ip_address TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create index for faster queries
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_log_action ON admin_audit_log(action);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_log_user ON admin_audit_log(affected_user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_log_created ON admin_audit_log(created_at);

-- Enable RLS (only service role can access)
ALTER TABLE admin_audit_log ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Only service role can access audit log"
ON admin_audit_log
FOR ALL
TO service_role
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

COMMENT ON TABLE admin_audit_log IS 'Audit trail for all admin actions';
```

---

## ‚úÖ Checklist

Before changing phone number:

- [ ] Customer identity verified (ID, email, bookings)
- [ ] Reason for change is legitimate
- [ ] New phone number tested (can receive SMS)
- [ ] Backup created in SQL
- [ ] Phone updated in profiles table
- [ ] Phone updated in auth.users (Dashboard)
- [ ] Change logged in audit_log
- [ ] New number tested (customer can log in)
- [ ] Customer notified of change
- [ ] Support ticket closed

---

## üí∞ Charging for Service

**Recommended:**
- **Free**: First change (legitimate reasons)
- **RM 10-20**: Additional changes
- **Free**: Lost/stolen phone (with police report)

This discourages abuse while helping genuine customers.

---

## üì± Alternative: Self-Service (Future)

For future consideration, implement self-service:

1. Customer requests change in app
2. Verify old number (OTP to old phone)
3. Verify new number (OTP to new phone)
4. Auto-update if both verified
5. Notify customer via email

**Pros:**
- Less support burden
- Instant resolution
- Better UX

**Cons:**
- More complex to implement
- Security considerations
- Fraud risk
