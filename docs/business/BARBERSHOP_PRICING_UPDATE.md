# Barbershop Pricing Model - Implementation Complete ✅

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Original Issue**: Staff members had individual service offerings with different prices, which doesn't reflect how real barbershops operate where the **shop sets all prices**, not individual staff.

## ✅ Changes Implemented

### 1. **Updated Type Definition** (`types/index.ts`)
Changed `BarbershopStaff` interface:

**Before:**
```typescript
services: Service[];  // Staff had their own services with prices
```

**After:**
```typescript
serviceIds: string[];  // Staff references shop's service IDs only
// Note: Actual prices come from the barbershop's service catalog
```

### 2. **Updated Mock Data** (`services/mockData.ts`)

**All 11 staff members now use `serviceIds`** instead of full service objects:

```typescript
// Example: Staff at The Gentleman Barber
{
  id: 'staff3',
  barbershopId: 'shop2',
  name: 'Vincent Lee',
  serviceIds: ['1', '2', '3', '4'], // References shop2's services
  // Shop2 services: Premium Cut (45), Hot Towel Shave (38), etc.
}
```

**Key Changes by Shop:**

| Shop | Staff | Service IDs | Notes |
|------|-------|-------------|-------|
| shop1 | staff1, staff2 | `['1','2','3']` | All can do all shop services |
| shop2 | staff3 | `['1','2','3','4']` | Master - all services |
| shop2 | staff4 | `['1','2','4']` | No hair coloring |
| shop3 | staff5 | `['1','2']` | Basic services only |
| shop4 | staff6 | `['1','2','3']` | All shop services |
| shop4 | staff7 | `['1','2']` | Apprentice - limited |
| shop7 | staff8 | `['1','2','3','4','5']` | Master - all services |
| shop7 | staff9 | `['1','3','5']` | Specializes in cuts & coloring |
| shop10 | staff10 | `['1','2','3','4']` | All shop services |
| shop10 | staff11 | `['1','4']` | Cuts & treatments only |

### 3. **Updated API Service** (`services/api.ts`)

Added new helper function:
```typescript
getStaffServices(staffId, shopId)
```

This function:
- Finds the staff member
- Finds the shop
- Returns only shop services that staff can perform
- **Prices always come from shop's catalog**

### 4. **Updated UI** (`app/barbershop/barbers/[shopId].tsx`)

#### Removed ❌:
- Individual "Starting from" price on each staff card
- Price calculations per staff member

#### Added ✅:
- **Green pricing banner** showing shop's lowest price at top
- Text: "All staff offer same services at shop's prices"
- Full-width green "Select" button on each staff card
- Button shows first name (e.g., "Select Vincent")

  price: "Starting from RM 35",
  travelCost: "RM 10" // Customer pays travel
}
```

### Barbershop Staff (In-Shop):

  serviceIds: string[], // ✅ References shop's service IDs
