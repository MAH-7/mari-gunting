- Server costs: ~RM 500/month
- Support staff: ~RM 3,000/month
- Marketing: ~RM 5,000/month
```

- Net profit for barber: ~RM 3-5 for 15km travel
- Barbers might reject long-distance bookings

#### 4. **No Room to Grow**
- Already at rock-bottom pricing
- Can't reduce further if competitor matches
- Hard to increase later (customers will complain)
- Locked into low-margin model

## My Recommendation üéØ

### Go with **Option C: Hybrid Launch Strategy**

**Start with YOUR pricing** to win the market:
```
‚úÖ Launch Phase (6 months):
- Travel: RM 5 base + RM 1/km after 4km
- Platform fee: RM 1
- Commission: 5%

Marketing: "Up to 50% cheaper travel fees!"
Goal: Get 1000+ bookings/month
```

**Then gradually increase:**
```
üìà Growth Phase:
- Platform fee: RM 1 ‚Üí RM 1.50 ‚Üí RM 2
- Commission: 5% ‚Üí 7% ‚Üí 10%

Communicate: "Introducing small platform fee to improve service"
```

---

## Why This Works

### 1. **Win Customers First**
Your pricing is **aggressive** and will attract customers quickly:
- Short trips (4km): RM 126 vs competitor RM 129.80 = Save RM 3.80
- Long trips (10km): RM 132 vs competitor RM 137 = Save RM 5

### 2. **Win Barbers**
Barbers earn more on your platform:
- 95-100% earnings vs competitor's ~80%
- Will attract the best barbers
- Better service quality

### 3. **Room to Scale**
Start cheap, increase gradually:
- Customers already locked in
- Won't switch for RM 1-2 difference
- By Phase 3, still cheaper than competitor

### 4. **Clear Value Prop**
"Cheapest + Best barbers + Great service"

---

**What's Great:**
- ‚úÖ Extremely competitive
