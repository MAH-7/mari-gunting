## 🎯 Overview

Successfully implemented a **comprehensive enhancement** of the booking details screen following Grab's senior dev best practices. The system now intelligently differentiates between **barbershop** and **freelance** bookings, providing context-aware UI, features, and information.

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### **Phase 1: Critical Fixes** 🔧

#### 1.1 Type System Enhancements
**File:** `types/index.ts`

- ✅ Added `BookingType` enum: `'on-demand' | 'scheduled-shop' | 'scheduled-home'`
- ✅ Added new booking statuses: `'confirmed'`, `'ready'`
- ✅ Enhanced `Booking` interface with:
  - `type: BookingType` field (required)
  - `shopId`, `shopName`, `shopAddress`, `shopPhone` (barbershop-specific)

#### 1.2 API Updates
**File:** `services/api.ts`

- ✅ Updated `createBooking` to require and validate `bookingType`
- ✅ Conditional initial status based on booking type
- ✅ Type-safe booking creation

#### 1.3 Barbershop Booking Flow
**File:** `app/barbershop/booking/[barberId].tsx`

- ✅ Passes `type: 'scheduled-shop'` when creating booking
- ✅ Includes shop details in booking payload

#### 1.4 Freelance Booking Flow
**File:** `app/booking/create.tsx`

- ✅ Passes `type: 'on-demand'` when creating booking
- ✅ Updated payment-method screen to handle both booking types

**File:** `app/payment-method.tsx`

- ✅ Smart detection of booking type
- ✅ Conditional field inclusion based on type
- ✅ Proper handling of barbershop vs freelance data

#### 1.5 Smart Status Timeline
**File:** `app/booking/[id]-enhanced.tsx`

**Barbershop Timeline:**
```
Booking Received → Confirmed → Ready for You → Service Started → Completed
```

**Freelance Timeline:**
```
Finding Barber → Barber Confirmed → On The Way → Service Started → Completed
```

#### 1.6 Travel Cost Display with Explanation
**Barbershop:**

## Appendix: Code Snippets

### Example: Detecting Booking Type
```typescript
const bookingType: BookingType = booking?.type || 
  (booking?.shopId ? 'scheduled-shop' : 'on-demand');
const isBarbershop = bookingType === 'scheduled-shop';
```

### Example: Smart Status Steps
```typescript
const getStatusSteps = () => {
  if (isBarbershop) {
    return [
      { key: 'pending', label: 'Booking Received' },
      { key: 'confirmed', label: 'Confirmed' },
      { key: 'ready', label: 'Ready for You' },
      { key: 'in-progress', label: 'Service Started' },
      { key: 'completed', label: 'Completed' },
    ];
  }
  return [
    { key: 'pending', label: 'Finding Barber' },
    { key: 'accepted', label: 'Barber Confirmed' },
    { key: 'on-the-way', label: 'On The Way' },
    { key: 'in-progress', label: 'Service Started' },
    { key: 'completed', label: 'Completed' },
  ];
};
```

### Example: Opening Maps
```typescript
const handleGetDirections = () => {
  const address = encodeURIComponent(booking.shopAddress);
  const url = Platform.select({
    ios: `maps://app?daddr=${address}`,
    android: `geo:0,0?q=${address}`,
  });
  
  Linking.openURL(url).catch(() => {
    Linking.openURL(`https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=${address}`);
  });
};
```
