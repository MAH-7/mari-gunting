## ✅ Core Features Implemented

### 1. Real-Time Location Tracking
- ✅ Subscribes to Supabase Realtime for barber profile updates
- ✅ Parses PostGIS WKB hex format location data
- ✅ Updates map markers automatically as barber moves
- ✅ Connection status indicator (Live Tracking / Connecting)

### 2. Interactive Map
- ✅ Mapbox GL integration
- ✅ Customer location pin (blue home icon)
- ✅ Barber location pin (green scissors icon)
- ✅ Auto-center button to focus on barber
- ✅ Fit-bounds button to show both locations
- ✅ Manual pan and zoom support

### 3. ETA Calculations
- ✅ Real-time distance calculation using Haversine formula
- ✅ Estimated time based on average urban speed (30 km/h)
- ✅ Live updates as barber location changes
- ✅ Displays: distance (km), time (min), last updated (seconds ago)

### 4. Arrival Notifications
- ✅ Triggered when barber is within 100 meters
- ✅ Custom sound alert (with fallback to system sound)
- ✅ Vibration pattern (iOS and Android)
- ✅ Push notification with title and body
- ✅ In-app alert dialog
- ✅ Only triggers once per arrival

### 5. UI Components
- ✅ Bottom info panel with barber details
- ✅ Barber avatar, name, and status
- ✅ Call barber button (ready for phone dialer integration)
- ✅ ETA metrics display
- ✅ Customer address display
- ✅ Error banner for connection issues
- ✅ Loading and error states

### 6. Background Support
- ✅ Handles app state changes
- ✅ Reconnects when app comes to foreground
- ✅ Cleans up subscriptions on unmount

## 🛠️ Dependencies Used

All required dependencies are already installed in your project:

- ✅ **@rnmapbox/maps** - Map rendering and controls
- ✅ **expo-notifications** - Push notifications
- ✅ **expo-av** - Audio playback for arrival sound
- ✅ **@supabase/supabase-js** - Realtime subscriptions
- ✅ **expo-router** - Navigation

---

## 🚀 Next Steps to Make It Work

### 1. Enable Supabase Realtime (Required)

Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Enable realtime for profiles table
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE profiles;
```

**Verify:**
```sql
-- Check if realtime is enabled
SELECT * FROM pg_publication_tables WHERE pubname = 'supabase_realtime';
-- Should show 'profiles' in the list
```

### 2. Add Arrival Sound File (Optional)

- Download or create an `arrival.mp3` file (1-3 seconds, pleasant notification sound)
- Place it at: `apps/customer/assets/sounds/arrival.mp3`
- See `apps/customer/assets/sounds/README.md` for specifications

**If skipped:** Feature will still work, falling back to system notification sound.

### 3. Integrate into Booking Screen

Add a "Track Barber" button to your booking details screen:

```tsx
// apps/customer/app/booking/[id].tsx

import { useRouter } from 'expo-router';

const router = useRouter();

// Add this button when booking status is 'on_the_way' or 'in_progress'
<TouchableOpacity 
  onPress={() => router.push(`/booking/track-barber?bookingId=${booking.id}`)}
  style={styles.trackButton}
>
  <Text>Track Barber</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

### 4. Test the Feature

**Prerequisites:**
1. Have a test booking in your database
2. Partner app must be updating location in real-time
3. Test on a physical device (not simulator for best results)

**Testing Steps:**
1. Create a booking
2. Open customer app and navigate to booking details
3. Tap "Track Barber"
4. Watch the map as barber location updates
5. Move partner device to trigger location updates
6. Verify ETA calculations update
7. Test arrival notification by moving within 100 meters

## 🎯 Usage Example

### Customer Flow

1. **Customer books a service**
   - Booking is created with status: `pending`

2. **Barber accepts and starts traveling**
   - Booking status changes to: `on_the_way`
   - "Track Barber" button becomes visible

3. **Customer taps "Track Barber"**
   - Opens full-screen map
   - Shows both customer and barber locations
   - Displays real-time ETA

4. **Barber location updates automatically**
   - Map updates in real-time
   - ETA recalculates
   - Connection status shows "Live Tracking"

5. **Barber arrives (within 100m)**
   - Notification sound plays
   - Device vibrates
   - Push notification sent
   - Alert dialog shows
   - Status: "Your barber has arrived!"

```

### Location Data Format

**Database Storage (PostGIS):**
```
GEOMETRY(Point, 4326)
Stored as: WKB (Well-Known Binary) hex string
Example: 0101000020E6100000F6285C8FC2F5594084E7B92DB5F01440
```

**Parsed to JavaScript:**
```typescript
{
  latitude: 5.2779,
  longitude: 103.161
}
```

### ETA Calculation

```typescript
// Haversine formula for distance
const R = 6371; // Earth radius in km
const distance = calculateDistance(from, to);

// Time estimation (urban speed)
const averageSpeed = 30; // km/h
const timeMinutes = (distance / averageSpeed) * 60;
```

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **No Route Line Yet**
   - Shows only pins, not the path
   - Future: Integrate Mapbox Directions API

2. **Fixed Average Speed**
   - Uses constant 30 km/h
   - Future: Integrate real-time traffic

3. **Single Arrival Notification**
   - Only at 100 meters
   - Future: Progressive notifications (10 min, 5 min, 2 min, arrived)

4. **Background Tracking Limitations**
   - iOS/Android may limit background updates
   - Future: Proper background location services

5. **Requires Internet**
   - No offline support
   - Future: Cache last known location
