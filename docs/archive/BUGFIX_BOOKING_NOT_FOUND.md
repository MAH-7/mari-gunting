# Bug Fix: Booking Not Found After Cash Payment

## Issue üêõ

**Problem:** After completing cash payment, the booking detail screen showed "Booking Not Found" error.

**Error Message:** "This booking doesn't exist or has been removed."

**Root Cause:** Two issues:
1. Created bookings were not being stored in the in-memory map
2. Booking object was missing the required `barber` field

---

## Fix Applied ‚úÖ

### 1. Store Created Bookings in Memory

**File:** `/services/api.ts`  
**Line:** 180-183

**Added:**
```typescript
// Store in memory so it can be retrieved later
createdBookings.set(newBooking.id, newBooking);

console.log('‚úÖ Booking created and stored:', newBooking.id);
```

**Why:** The `createBooking` function was creating bookings but not storing them in the `createdBookings` Map, so when `getBookingById` tried to retrieve them, they weren't found.

---

### 2. Include Full Barber Object in Booking

**File:** `/app/payment-method.tsx`  
**Lines:** 119-132

**Added:**
```typescript
// Fetch barber details to include in booking
const barberResponse = await api.getBarberById(params.barberId);
const barber = barberResponse.data;

if (!barber) {
  throw new Error('Barber not found');
}

// Create booking
const createBookingResponse = await api.createBooking({
  barberId: params.barberId,
  barberName: params.barberName,
  barberAvatar: params.barberAvatar,
  barber: barber, // Include full barber object ‚Üê NEW!
  // ... rest of booking data
});
```

**Why:** The booking detail screen expects a `barber` object to display barber information (avatar, name, rating, phone, etc.). Without it, the screen couldn't render properly.

## Technical Details

### Booking Flow After Fix:

```
User selects "Cash" payment
    ‚Üì
1. Parse booking data from params
2. Fetch barber details via API ‚Üê NEW STEP
3. Create booking with complete data including barber object
4. Store booking in createdBookings Map ‚Üê NOW HAPPENS
5. Get booking ID from response
6. Show "Booking Confirmed" alert
7. Navigate to /booking/[id]
8. Fetch booking by ID ‚Üí FOUND! ‚úÖ
9. Display booking detail screen
```

### What Was Missing:

**Before Fix:**
```typescript
// In api.ts createBooking
const newBooking = { ... };
return { data: newBooking }; // NOT STORED!
```

**After Fix:**
```typescript
// In api.ts createBooking
const newBooking = { ... };
createdBookings.set(newBooking.id, newBooking); // NOW STORED!
return { data: newBooking };
```

## Why This Happened

This issue occurred because:

1. **In-Memory Storage Pattern:** The mock API uses an in-memory `Map` to simulate database storage for testing. The `createBooking` function was creating bookings but forgot to store them in this Map.

2. **Missing Data Structure:** The Booking interface expects a `barber?: Barber` field for displaying barber details, but we were only passing `barberId`, `barberName`, and `barberAvatar` strings.

---

## Production Notes

When integrating with a real backend:

1. **Real Database:** The backend will persist bookings in a real database, so the in-memory Map won't be needed.

2. **API Response:** Ensure the backend's `createBooking` endpoint returns the complete booking object including the barber details, or make a separate call to fetch barber info.

3. **Data Structure:** Make sure the backend returns booking data with all required fields matching the `Booking` interface.
