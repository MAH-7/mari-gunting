## 💡 Code Highlights

### Calendar Configuration
```typescript
<Calendar
  current={selectedDate}
  onDayPress={(day) => setSelectedDate(day.dateString)}
  markedDates={markedDates}
  markingType={'multi-dot'}
  theme={{
    selectedDayBackgroundColor: COLORS.primary,
    todayTextColor: COLORS.primary,
    dotColor: COLORS.primary,
    // ... more theme options
  }}
/>
```

### Marked Dates Logic
```typescript
const markedDates = useMemo(() => {
  const marked: any = {};
  
  providerBookings.forEach((booking) => {
    if (booking.scheduledDate) {
      // Add colored dot based on status
      const color = booking.status === 'completed' ? COLORS.success :
                    booking.status === 'accepted' ? COLORS.primary :
                    COLORS.warning;
      
      marked[date].dots.push({ color });
    }
  });
  
  return marked;
}, [providerBookings, selectedDate]);
```

### Working Hours State
```typescript
const [workingHours, setWorkingHours] = useState<Record<DayOfWeek, WorkingHours>>({
  monday: { start: '09:00', end: '18:00', isEnabled: true },
  tuesday: { start: '09:00', end: '18:00', isEnabled: true },
  // ... other days
  sunday: { start: '00:00', end: '00:00', isEnabled: false },
});
```

## 📝 Notes

### Design Decisions
1. **Calendar Library:** Used `react-native-calendars` for its robustness and community support
2. **Multi-dot Marking:** Allows multiple bookings per day to be visualized
3. **Bottom Sheet Modal:** Better UX than full-screen for working hours
4. **Color Coding:** Consistent with rest of app (green=good, yellow=pending, etc.)

### Performance Considerations
- UseMemo for expensive calculations (marked dates, filtered bookings)
- Optimized re-renders
- Efficient date filtering
- Lightweight components

### Accessibility
- Clear labels and text
- Color contrast meets standards
- Large tap targets (>44px)
- Screen reader friendly
