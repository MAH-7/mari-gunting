## 🔄 Data Flow

### Booking List Flow:
```
User opens Bookings Screen
    ↓
React Query fetches data
    ↓
bookingService.getCustomerBookings(userId, status, limit, offset)
    ↓
Supabase RPC: get_customer_bookings
    ↓
Database returns enriched booking data
    ↓
Data cached by React Query (30s stale time)
    ↓
UI renders with BookingCard components
```

## 👥 Team Notes

### For Frontend Developers:
- All services return `ApiResponse<T>` type
- Check `success` field before accessing `data`
- Use React Query hooks for data fetching
- Invalidate queries after mutations

### For Backend Developers:
- RPC functions follow `p_` parameter convention
- Return JSONB for complex objects
- Use RLS policies for security
- Add indexes for query performance

### For QA/Testing:
- Test with multiple user accounts
- Verify data isolation between users
- Test error scenarios (no network, etc.)
- Check edge cases (empty lists, etc.)
