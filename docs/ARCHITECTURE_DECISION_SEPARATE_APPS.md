# Architecture Decision: Separate vs. Combined Apps

**Date:** January 2025  
**Decision:** To Be Determined  
**Impact:** High - Affects entire project structure

---

## 🤔 The Question

Should Mari Gunting be:
1. **One Combined App** - Customers and service providers (barbershops/freelancers) in the same app
2. **Separate Apps** - Two distinct apps for each user type

---

## 📊 Current State Analysis

### Your Current Setup
- ✅ **Single codebase** with combined functionality
- ✅ Role selection screen (`select-role.tsx`)
- ✅ Shared components and navigation
- ✅ Both customer and provider flows in one app

### Current File Structure
```
/app/
  ├── (tabs)/           # Customer main navigation
  ├── barbershop/       # Barbershop-specific screens
  ├── barber/           # Freelance barber screens
  ├── booking/          # Shared booking screens
  ├── select-role.tsx   # Role selection
  └── ...
```

## 🏢 Industry Examples

### Combined App Approach
- **Airbnb** - Hosts and guests in one app
- **Uber Eats** - Customers and restaurant partners (delivery separate)
- **Fiverr** - Buyers and sellers in one app

### Separate App Approach
- **Uber** - Uber (riders) + Uber Driver (separate)
- **Grab** - Grab (passengers) + GrabDriver (separate)
- **Gojek** - Gojek (customers) + Gojek Driver (separate)
- **DoorDash** - DoorDash (customers) + Dasher (separate)

**Observation:** Most on-demand/gig economy services with **real-time tracking and professional providers** use separate apps.

---

## 💡 Recommendation

### 🎯 **RECOMMENDED: Separate Apps**

Here's why this is the right choice for Mari Gunting:

### Rationale

#### 1. **Your Market Position**
- You're competing with established players (Grab, Gojek)
- Users expect professional, focused apps
- Barbershops/freelancers need business tools, not consumer features
- Customers want simplicity, not business complexity

#### 2. **User Psychology**
- **Customers** want: Simple booking, track barber, pay, done
- **Providers** want: Manage bookings, track earnings, view analytics
- These are **fundamentally different mental models**

#### 3. **Growth Potential**
- Easier to scale customer acquisition separately
- Easier to add provider-specific features (scheduling, analytics, payments)
- Can innovate per user type without affecting the other
- Better app store visibility

#### 4. **Professional Image**
- Separate apps signal seriousness and professionalism
- Providers feel like they have a "business tool"
- Customers feel like they have a "service they use"

#### 5. **Technical Cleanliness**
- Simpler to reason about each codebase
- Easier to onboard new developers
- Less technical debt
- Better performance

## 🚀 Implementation Strategy

If you decide to separate (recommended):

### Phase 1: Planning (Week 1)
1. **Audit Current Code**
   - Identify truly shared code (40-50%)
   - Identify customer-only code (25-30%)
   - Identify provider-only code (25-30%)

2. **Design Shared Library**
   - Create `@marigunting/shared` package
   - Include: Types, utilities, API services, common components
   - Set up as local npm package or monorepo

3. **Plan App Structure**
   ```
   mari-gunting/
   ├── packages/
   │   └── shared/          # Shared code
   ├── apps/
   │   ├── customer/        # Customer app
   │   └── provider/        # Provider app (barbershop + freelance)
   └── package.json         # Monorepo root
   ```

### Phase 2: Shared Package (Week 2)
1. Extract shared code:
   - `/types` → `@marigunting/shared/types`
   - `/utils` → `@marigunting/shared/utils`
   - `/services` → `@marigunting/shared/services`
   - Common components → `@marigunting/shared/components`

2. Set up build pipeline for shared package

### Phase 3: Customer App (Week 3)
1. Create new customer app
2. Import shared package
3. Add customer-specific screens:
   - Home (browse services)
   - Barbershops list
   - Barbers list
   - Quick book
   - Booking details
   - Profile
   - Rewards

### Phase 4: Partner App (Week 4)
1. Create partner app
2. Import shared package
3. Add provider-specific screens:
   - Dashboard (bookings, earnings)
   - Booking management
   - Schedule management
   - Earnings/analytics
   - Profile/settings

### Phase 5: Testing & Launch (Week 5-6)
1. Test both apps thoroughly
2. Update app store listings
3. Create separate marketing materials
4. Soft launch to test users

## 🎬 My Recommendation

### **Option: Hybrid Approach** 🌟

Here's what I'd actually recommend:

1. **Launch Combined App FIRST** (This week)
   - Get to market fast
   - Validate product-market fit
   - Start getting users and feedback
   - Generate revenue

2. **Split After Validation** (Month 2-3)
   - Once you have 100+ users
   - Once you've proven the concept
   - Once you have revenue to fund it
   - Once you know what users actually need

### Why This Works
- ✅ **Fast to market** - Don't delay launch
- ✅ **Validate first** - Make sure people want this
- ✅ **Informed decision** - Real data to guide split
- ✅ **Funded split** - Use early revenue to fund separation
- ✅ **Better design** - Know what features matter most

### The Path
```
Month 1: Launch combined app
         ↓
Month 2: Get 100+ users, gather feedback
         ↓
Month 3: Analyze data, plan split if needed
         ↓
Month 4-5: Build separate apps
         ↓
Month 6: Transition users to new apps
```
