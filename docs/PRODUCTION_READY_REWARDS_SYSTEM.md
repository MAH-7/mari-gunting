## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Current Implementation (Mock Data)
- Points stored in Zustand (client-side only)
- Vouchers stored locally
- No server validation

### Production Requirements
When implementing real backend:
1. **Server-side Validation**
   - Validate all point calculations on server
   - Verify voucher eligibility server-side
   - Prevent client-side manipulation

2. **Database Schema**
   ```sql
   -- Users table (add columns)
   ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN points_balance INT DEFAULT 0;
   
   -- Points transactions
   CREATE TABLE points_transactions (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
     booking_id UUID REFERENCES bookings(id),
     amount INT NOT NULL,
     type ENUM('earn', 'redeem'),
     description TEXT,
     created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   
   -- Vouchers
   CREATE TABLE vouchers (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     code VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE,
     type ENUM('percentage', 'fixed'),
     value DECIMAL(10,2),
     points_cost INT,
     expiry_date DATE,
     created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   
   -- User vouchers
   CREATE TABLE user_vouchers (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
     voucher_id UUID REFERENCES vouchers(id),
     redeemed_at TIMESTAMP,
     used_at TIMESTAMP,
     used_for_booking_id UUID REFERENCES bookings(id),
     status ENUM('active', 'used', 'expired')
   );
   ```

3. **API Endpoints Needed**
   ```
   POST /api/bookings/:id/complete   # Award points on completion
   POST /api/vouchers/:id/redeem     # Redeem voucher with points
   POST /api/bookings/:id/apply-voucher  # Apply voucher to booking
   GET /api/users/:id/points         # Get user points balance
   GET /api/users/:id/vouchers       # Get user's vouchers
   GET /api/vouchers/available       # Get available vouchers to redeem
   ```

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Mock Data Environment
1. **No Persistence:** Points and vouchers reset on app restart
2. **No Sync:** Changes not synced across devices
3. **No Validation:** Client-side only, can be manipulated
4. **Test Function:** `simulateBookingCompletion` commented out but available for re-enabling during testing

### Future Enhancements
1. **Referral System:** Earn points for referring friends
2. **Tier System:** Bronze, Silver, Gold tiers with benefits
3. **Special Promotions:** Double points days, bonus vouchers
4. **Push Notifications:** Notify when vouchers expire soon
5. **Social Sharing:** Share rewards achievements
6. **Leaderboard:** Top earners of the month

## 🎓 Developer Guide

### Adding New Voucher Types
```typescript
// In /store/useStore.ts

// Add new voucher type
type VoucherType = 'percentage' | 'fixed' | 'free-service'; // Add new type

// Update voucher structure
interface Voucher {
  // ... existing fields
  serviceId?: string; // For free-service type
}

// Update discount calculation in payment-method.tsx
const calculateDiscount = (voucher: Voucher, subtotal: number) => {
  if (voucher.type === 'percentage') {
    return subtotal * (voucher.value / 100);
  } else if (voucher.type === 'fixed') {
    return Math.min(voucher.value, subtotal);
  } else if (voucher.type === 'free-service') {
    // Custom logic for free service
    return 0; // Implement as needed
  }
  return 0;
};
```

### Testing Rewards (Development)
To test the rewards system during development:

1. **Uncomment Test Function** in `/services/api.ts`:
   ```typescript
   export const simulateBookingCompletion = (bookingId: string): boolean => {
     // ... existing code
   };
   ```

2. **Re-enable Test Button** in `/app/booking/[id].tsx`:
   ```typescript
   {booking?.status !== 'completed' && booking?.status !== 'cancelled' && (
     <TouchableOpacity
       style={styles.testCompleteButton}
       onPress={handleTestComplete}
     >
       <Ionicons name="checkmark-done" size={20} color="#00B14F" />
       <Text style={styles.testCompleteButtonText}>🧪 Test: Mark as Completed</Text>
     </TouchableOpacity>
   )}
   ```

3. **Add Back Test Styles**:
   ```typescript
   testCompleteButton: {
     flexDirection: 'row',
     alignItems: 'center',
     justifyContent: 'center',
     gap: 8,
     paddingVertical: 14,
     backgroundColor: '#F0FDF4',
     borderRadius: 8,
     borderWidth: 2,
     borderColor: '#00B14F',
     borderStyle: 'dashed',
   },
   testCompleteButtonText: {
     fontSize: 16,
     fontWeight: '600',
     color: '#00B14F',
   },
   ```
