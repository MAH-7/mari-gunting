## 🐛 Issues Resolved

### Issue #1: Modal Not Opening
**Problem**: Completion modal wouldn't open when tapping "Complete Job"  
**Cause**: Two modals trying to render simultaneously  
**Solution**: Conditional rendering - hide job details modal when completion modal is active  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

### Issue #2: Status Updates Not Persisting
**Problem**: Status buttons showed alerts but didn't update job status  
**Cause**: Mock data wasn't being updated  
**Solution**: Added `jobStatusOverrides` state to track status changes locally  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

### Issue #3: Image Picker from Library Failed
**Problem**: "Choose from Library" threw error - function not defined  
**Cause**: Using deprecated API `launchImagePickerAsync`  
**Solution**: Updated to `launchImageLibraryAsync` and `['images']` mediaTypes  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed
