# Rewards System Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide covers end-to-end testing of the complete rewards system including:
1. **Points Earning**: Automatic points awarded on booking completion
2. **Voucher Redemption**: Redeeming vouchers with points
3. **Voucher Usage**: Applying vouchers to bookings for discounts

---

## Prerequisites

### 1. Apply Database Migrations
```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /Users/bos/Desktop/ProjectSideIncome/mari-gunting

# Apply the rewards system migrations (if not done already)
# You can apply these via Supabase Dashboard or CLI:
# - 010_rewards_system.sql
# - 011_rewards_seed_data.sql
# - 012_booking_vouchers_and_auto_points.sql
```

### 2. Verify Database Setup
Check in Supabase Dashboard that these tables exist:
- ‚úÖ `vouchers`
- ‚úÖ `user_vouchers`
- ‚úÖ `points_transactions`
- ‚úÖ `booking_vouchers`
- ‚úÖ `profiles` (with `points_balance` column)
- ‚úÖ `bookings` (with `discount_amount` column)

### 3. Verify Functions/Triggers
Check that these exist in Supabase:
- ‚úÖ Function: `award_points()`
- ‚úÖ Function: `redeem_voucher()`
- ‚úÖ Function: `use_voucher()`
- ‚úÖ Function: `apply_voucher_to_booking()`
- ‚úÖ Function: `award_points_on_completion()`
- ‚úÖ Trigger: `trigger_award_points_on_completion` on `bookings` table

## Test Scenario 1: Points Earning on Booking Completion

### Objective
Verify that points are automatically awarded when a booking is marked as completed.

### Steps

#### 1. Note Starting Points
1. Open the customer app
2. Go to **Rewards** tab
3. Note your current points balance (e.g., 0 pts)
4. Take a screenshot

#### 2. Create a Booking
1. Go to **Home** tab
2. Select any barber
3. Select a service (e.g., "Classic Haircut - RM 30")
4. Complete the booking flow:
   - Select address
   - Choose payment method (Cash is easiest for testing)
   - Confirm booking
5. Note the **service price** (subtotal) - this is what earns points
   - Example: RM 30 service = 300 points (10 points per RM)

#### 3. Verify No Points Yet
1. Go to **Rewards** tab
2. Points should still be **unchanged** (0 pts)
3. Go to **Activity** tab in Rewards
4. Should see **no new entry** for this booking yet

‚úÖ **Expected**: No points awarded at payment time

#### 4. Complete the Booking

**Option A: Via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended for Testing)**
1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to **Table Editor** ‚Üí `bookings`
3. Find your booking (sort by `created_at` desc)
4. Edit the row
5. Change `status` from `pending` to `completed`
6. Save

**Option B: Via SQL**
```sql
-- Replace with your booking ID
UPDATE bookings 
SET status = 'completed', completed_at = NOW() 
WHERE id = 'YOUR_BOOKING_ID';
```

#### 5. Verify Points Awarded
1. Go back to customer app
2. Go to **Rewards** tab
3. Pull to refresh
4. **Points should increase!** (0 ‚Üí 300 for RM 30 booking)
5. Tap **Activity** tab
6. Should see new entry:
   ```
   +300 pts
   Earned from booking completion
   [Today's date]
   ```

‚úÖ **Expected Results:**
- Points balance increased by (service_price √ó 10)
- Activity log shows new transaction
- Transaction type: `earn`
- Description mentions booking completion

#### 6. Verify Database Records
Check in Supabase Dashboard:

**profiles table:**
```sql
SELECT id, full_name, points_balance 
FROM profiles 
WHERE id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';
```
- `points_balance` should match app display

**points_transactions table:**
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM points_transactions 
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```
Should show:
- `type`: `earn`
- `amount`: 300 (for RM 30 booking)
- `description`: Something about booking completion
- `booking_id`: Matches your booking
- `balance_after`: Your new balance

## Test Scenario 4: Complete Rewards Loop

### Objective
Test the full rewards lifecycle: earn ‚Üí redeem ‚Üí use ‚Üí earn again.

### Steps

1. **Complete the booking from Scenario 3**
   - Update booking status to `completed` in Supabase
   - Service was RM 20 ‚Üí Earns 200 points

2. **Verify Points Awarded**
   - Points increase (e.g., 200 ‚Üí 400)
   - Activity log shows "+200 pts" from booking

3. **Redeem Another Voucher**
   - Use the 400 points to redeem another voucher
   - Points decrease (e.g., 400 ‚Üí 220 after redeeming 180pt voucher)

4. **Use New Voucher on Next Booking**
   - Create another booking
   - Apply the newly redeemed voucher
   - Complete booking
   - Earn points again

5. **Check Total Points History**
   - Should see full transaction history:
     - +300 (first booking)
     - -100 (voucher redemption)
     - +200 (second booking)
     - -180 (second voucher redemption)
   - Final balance should match calculations

---

## Edge Cases to Test

### 1. Expired Voucher
```sql
-- Manually expire a voucher for testing
UPDATE vouchers 
SET valid_until = NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day' 
WHERE code = 'SAVE5';
```
- Try to redeem ‚Üí Should fail with error
- Check app shows voucher as expired

### 2. Insufficient Points
- Try to redeem a voucher that costs more points than you have
- Should see error: "You don't have enough points"

### 3. Minimum Spend Not Met
- Try to apply RM 30 OFF voucher to a RM 20 booking
- Voucher should be grayed out or not show as option
- Check minimum spend requirement is enforced

### 4. Already Used Voucher
- Try to use a voucher that's already marked as used
- Should not appear in "Select Voucher" modal
- Only show active vouchers

### 5. Cancelled Booking (No Points)
1. Create a booking
2. Cancel it before completion
3. Verify NO points awarded
4. Only completed bookings earn points

## SQL Queries for Testing

### Check User's Points and Vouchers
```sql
-- User profile with points
SELECT 
  id,
  full_name,
  points_balance
FROM profiles 
WHERE id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';

-- User's vouchers
SELECT 
  uv.*,
  v.title,
  v.code,
  v.type,
  v.value
FROM user_vouchers uv
JOIN vouchers v ON uv.voucher_id = v.id
WHERE uv.user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID'
ORDER BY uv.redeemed_at DESC;

-- Points transactions
SELECT 
  type,
  amount,
  balance_after,
  description,
  created_at
FROM points_transactions
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Check Booking with Voucher
```sql
-- Booking details
SELECT 
  b.id,
  b.booking_number,
  b.status,
  b.subtotal,
  b.discount_amount,
  b.total_price,
  bv.voucher_code,
  bv.discount_applied,
  uv.status as voucher_status
FROM bookings b
LEFT JOIN booking_vouchers bv ON b.id = bv.booking_id
LEFT JOIN user_vouchers uv ON bv.user_voucher_id = uv.id
WHERE b.id = 'YOUR_BOOKING_ID';
```

### Manually Award Points (for testing)
```sql
-- Award 500 test points
SELECT award_points(
  'YOUR_USER_ID'::uuid,
  500,
  'admin_adjustment',
  '{"reason": "testing"}'::jsonb
);
```

## Next Steps After Testing
