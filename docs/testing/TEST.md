# Testing NativeWind

## Current Setup
- NativeWind: v2.0.11
- Tailwind CSS: 3.3.2
- Babel plugin: 'nativewind/babel'

## Test This

1. Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
2. Delete caches:
   ```bash
   rm -rf .expo node_modules/.cache
   ```
3. Start fresh:
   ```bash
   npm start -- --clear
   ```
4. Wait for Metro to fully load
5. Press `r` to reload

## Check Terminal

Look for any ERRORS related to:
- Babel
- NativeWind
- className
- Tailwind

## Alternative: Use React Native StyleSheet

If NativeWind still doesn't work, I can convert everything to use React Native's built-in StyleSheet API instead. This will work 100% guaranteed.

Would you like me to:
1. Keep troubleshooting NativeWind
2. Convert to StyleSheet (guaranteed to work)

StyleSheet conversion would take about 10 minutes and will look identical.
