# Complete Fix Summary - Upload & Camera Errors

## 📋 Overview
This document summarizes all the fixes applied to resolve upload and camera errors in the Mari Gunting partner app.

## ✅ Problems Fixed (Code)

### 1. Upload Error - FIXED ✅
**Error**: `Calling the 'readAsStringAsync' function has failed → The 1st argument cannot be cast to type URL`

**Root Cause**:
- `uploadFile()` was being called with wrong parameter format
- No URI validation before upload
- Deprecated ImagePicker API usage

**Solution Applied**:
- ✅ Fixed parameter passing to use object structure
- ✅ Added URI validation in all image picker flows
- ✅ Updated to new `mediaTypes: ['images']` format
- ✅ Added proper error handling and logging
- ✅ Wrapped uploads in try-catch blocks

**Files Modified**:
- `packages/shared/services/onboardingService.ts`
- `apps/partner/app/onboarding/barber/ekyc.tsx`
- `apps/partner/app/onboarding/barber/service-details.tsx`
- `apps/partner/app/onboarding/barbershop/documents.tsx`
- `apps/partner/app/portfolio/index.tsx`
- `apps/partner/app/(tabs)/jobs.tsx`

### 2. Camera Error - FIXED ✅
**Error**: `Camera not available on simulator`

**Root Cause**:
- iOS simulator doesn't have camera support
- No user-friendly error messages

**Solution Applied**:
- ✅ Installed `expo-device` package
- ✅ Added simulator detection before camera launch
- ✅ Show helpful alert directing users to gallery option
- ✅ Better error messages for camera failures

**Files Modified**:
- Same files as above
- `apps/partner/package.json` (added expo-device)

### 3. Deprecated API Warning - FIXED ✅
**Warning**: `ImagePicker.MediaTypeOptions have been deprecated`

**Solution Applied**:
- ✅ Replaced all `ImagePicker.MediaTypeOptions.Images` with `['images']`

## ⚠️ Configuration Required (Supabase)

### Missing Storage Buckets
**Error**: `Bucket not found` for `barber-portfolio`

**What's Needed**:
You need to create storage buckets in Supabase. I've created the migration script for you.

**Buckets to Create**:
1. `barber-documents` - IC photos, selfies, certificates
2. `barber-portfolio` - Portfolio images ⚠️ **MISSING**
3. `barbershop-images` - Logos, covers
4. `barbershop-documents` - SSM, licenses
5. `avatars` - Profile pictures
6. `portfolios` - Legacy support
7. `barbershops` - Legacy support

## 🚀 Quick Fix Instructions

### Step 1: Supabase Setup (2 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Go to https://app.supabase.com
# 2. Select your project
# 3. Click "SQL Editor"
