# WhatsApp Sandbox Not Available - Alternative Solutions

## üéØ The Situation

You tried to add WhatsApp sandbox to your Messaging Service, but you got:

> "You don't have an approved WhatsApp profile. You can apply for one here."

**What this means:**
- Twilio changed how WhatsApp sandbox works
- You need to apply for WhatsApp Business API approval first
- The old sandbox setup (for testing) is no longer available through Messaging Services
- This is a new Twilio policy change

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION 1: Use SMS OTP Instead (Recommended for Testing)

WhatsApp is complex for testing. Let's use SMS OTP which works immediately!

### Configure Supabase for SMS

1. **Go to Supabase Auth Settings:**
   ```
   https://app.supabase.com/project/uufiyurcsldecspakneg/auth/providers
   ```

2. **Scroll to "Phone" section**

3. **Update configuration:**
   ```
   ‚òë Enable Phone provider: ON
   
   Provider: Twilio
   
   Twilio Account SID: ACxxxxxxxxxx (your SID)
   Twilio Auth Token: xxxxxxxxxx (your token)
   Twilio Messaging Service SID: [LEAVE EMPTY OR REMOVE]
   ```

4. **Important:** Delete or leave empty the "Messaging Service SID" field

5. **Get a Twilio Phone Number:**
   - Go to: https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/phone-numbers/manage/search
   - Search for a phone number in your country (Malaysia: +60)
   - Buy one (trial accounts get one free number!)
   - This will be used to send SMS

6. **Add phone number to Supabase:**
   ```
   In Supabase Phone settings, you might see:
   "Twilio Phone Number" field
   
   Enter your Twilio phone number: +1XXXXXXXXXX
   (the one you just got)
   ```

7. **Click Save**

### Test SMS OTP

1. **In your app, click "Send OTP"**
2. **You'll receive SMS (not WhatsApp) with the code**
3. **Enter the code and verify**
4. **Works exactly the same!** ‚úÖ

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ Works immediately
- ‚úÖ No WhatsApp approval needed
- ‚úÖ Perfect for development/testing
- ‚úÖ Cheaper than WhatsApp
- ‚úÖ Same user experience

**Disadvantage:**
- SMS instead of WhatsApp (users need cellular service, not just internet)

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION 2: Use Dev Mode (Best for Development)

While you're developing, just use test OTP mode (no Twilio needed)!

### Configure Dev Mode

1. **In both .env files, set:**
   ```bash
   # apps/customer/.env
   EXPO_PUBLIC_USE_REAL_OTP=false
   
   # apps/partner/.env
   EXPO_PUBLIC_USE_REAL_OTP=false
   ```

2. **Restart your app:**
   ```bash
   cd apps/customer
   npx expo start -c
   ```

3. **Test with fixed OTP: 123456**
   - No Twilio costs
   - No setup needed
   - Works offline
   - Perfect for development

### When to Use Dev Mode

Use dev mode when:
- ‚úÖ Developing features
- ‚úÖ Testing UI/UX
- ‚úÖ Running on simulator
- ‚úÖ No need for real phone verification
- ‚úÖ Want to save Twilio credits

Switch to SMS/WhatsApp when:
- ‚ùå Testing on real devices
- ‚ùå Doing end-to-end testing
- ‚ùå Pre-production testing
- ‚ùå Demoing to clients

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION 3: Apply for WhatsApp Business API (For Production)

   ```
   https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/sms/senders
   ```

2. **Click "Get Started with WhatsApp"** or **"Request Access"**

3. **Fill in your business information:**
   ```

   Use Case: Customer authentication and appointment notifications
   Business Type: Technology/Platform
   Country: Malaysia
   ```

4. **Submit application**

2. **Create message templates for OTP**

4. **Configure Supabase with Messaging Service SID**
5. **Test and deploy!**

### Cost Estimate
