# Fixes Applied - Upload and Camera Errors

## Date: 2025-01-12

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Upload Error - Invalid URI
**Problem:**
- Error: `Calling the 'readAsStringAsync' function has failed â†’ The 1st argument cannot be cast to type URL`
- The `uploadOnboardingImage` function was calling `uploadFile` with incorrect parameters
- Image picker was not properly validating URIs before upload

**Solution:**
- Fixed `uploadOnboardingImage` in `packages/shared/services/onboardingService.ts`:
  - Updated to call `uploadFile` with correct object parameter structure
  - Added URI validation before upload
  - Added better error logging and handling
  
- Updated all image picker implementations to:
  - Use the new `mediaTypes: ['images']` format (deprecated `MediaTypeOptions.Images`)
  - Validate URIs before processing
  - Add proper null/undefined checks
  - Wrap uploads in try-catch blocks for better error handling

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/shared/services/onboardingService.ts`
- `apps/partner/app/onboarding/barber/ekyc.tsx`
- `apps/partner/app/onboarding/barber/service-details.tsx`
- `apps/partner/app/onboarding/barbershop/documents.tsx`
- `apps/partner/app/portfolio/index.tsx`
- `apps/partner/app/(tabs)/jobs.tsx`

### 2. Camera Error - Simulator Not Supported
**Problem:**
- Error: `Camera not available on simulator`
- The app was trying to use the camera on iOS simulator which doesn't have camera support
- No user-friendly error message explaining the limitation

**Solution:**
- Installed `expo-device` package for device detection
- Added simulator detection before attempting to launch camera:
  ```typescript
  const isSimulator = !Device.isDevice;
  
  if (isSimulator) {
    Alert.alert(
      'Camera Not Available',
      'Camera is not available on simulator. Please use "Choose from Gallery" instead.',
      [{ text: 'OK' }]
    );
    return;
  }
  ```
- Added better error messages for camera-related failures
- Users now see clear guidance to use "Choose from Gallery" when on simulator

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/partner/app/onboarding/barber/ekyc.tsx`
- `apps/partner/app/portfolio/index.tsx`
- `apps/partner/app/(tabs)/jobs.tsx`

### 3. Deprecated API Usage
**Problem:**
- Warning: `[expo-image-picker] ImagePicker.MediaTypeOptions have been deprecated`

**Solution:**
- Replaced all instances of `ImagePicker.MediaTypeOptions.Images` with `['images']`
- Updated to use the new array-based format as recommended by Expo

## Testing Recommendations

1. **On Simulator:**
   - Test image selection from gallery (should work)
   - Test camera button (should show user-friendly message)
   - Verify upload functionality works with gallery images

2. **On Physical Device:**
   - Test camera capture
   - Test gallery selection
   - Verify uploads complete successfully
   - Check that images appear correctly after upload

3. **Error Cases:**
   - Cancel image selection (should handle gracefully)
   - Network errors during upload (should show appropriate error)
   - Invalid file selections (should validate and reject)

## Dependencies Added

- `expo-device` (v54.0.0) - For simulator detection

## Next Steps

1. Test the fixes on both simulator and physical device
2. Monitor Supabase logs for any upload issues
3. Consider adding image compression before upload (currently commented out in storage.ts)
4. Consider adding upload progress indicators for better UX
