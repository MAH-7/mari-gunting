## 🏗️ Architecture Summary

### State Management
```typescript
// Zustand Store Structure
onboardingData: {
  progress: {
    status: 'ekyc_submitted' | 'ekyc_passed' | ...,
    accountType: 'freelance' | 'barbershop',
    currentStep: number,
    totalSteps: number,
    completedSteps: string[],
  },
  ekyc: {
    fullName: string,
    nricNumber: string, // masked
    nricFrontUrl: string,
    nricBackUrl: string,
    selfieUrl: string,
    verificationStatus: 'pending' | 'verified',
  },
  // ... more data as we progress
}
```

### Route Guard Logic
```
User on Step 1 tries to access Step 5
    ↓
Layout detects status mismatch
    ↓
Auto-redirect to correct step (Step 2)
```

### Form Validation Pattern
```typescript
// Each form screen:
1. Local state for form fields
2. Errors state for validation
3. validateForm() function
4. Real-time error clearing
5. Submit only when valid
6. Update Zustand store
7. Navigate to next step
```

## 📱 User Flow So Far

```

    ↓
[Account Type] (Choose Freelance or Barbershop)
    ↓
[eKYC] (Upload NRIC + Selfie)
    ↓

    ↓
    ├─ If Barbershop → [Business Details] (TODO)

```
