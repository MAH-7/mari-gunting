## ⚠️ **Known Gaps (Minor)**

   - Login screens use different formats
   - **Fix:** Week 7 - Normalize phone handling

3. **Blocked dates not implemented**
   - Button exists but feature incomplete
   - **Fix:** Week 7 or 8 - Add blocked dates modal

### **🟢 Low Priority (Future):**
4. **No real-time notifications** - Requires backend
5. **No in-app chat** - Future enhancement
6. **No rating from provider side** - Future enhancement
