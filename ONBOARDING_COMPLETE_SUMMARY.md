## üöÄ Remaining 4 Screens - Quick Templates

### Screen 5: Staff & Services (Most Complex)

**File:** `apps/partner/app/onboarding/barbershop/staff-services.tsx`

**Key Pattern:** Dynamic lists with add/remove

```typescript
// State
const [staff, setStaff] = useState<Array<{name: string; role: string; specializations: string[]}>>([]);
const [services, setServices] = useState<Array<{name: string; price: number; duration: number}>>([]);

// Add staff member
const addStaff = (member: {name: string; role: string; specializations: string[]}) => {
  setStaff([...staff, member]);
};

// Add service
const addService = (service: {name: string; price: number; duration: number}) => {
  setServices([...services, service]);
};

// Validation
- Minimum 1 staff member
- Minimum 3 services
- All fields required for each item

// Save
await barbershopOnboardingService.saveProgress('staffServices', { staff, services });
router.push('/onboarding/barbershop/amenities');
```

**UI Components:**
- Modal/form to add staff (name, role dropdown, specializations chips)
- List of added staff with remove button
- Modal/form to add service (name, price RM, duration minutes)
- List of added services with remove button

**Estimated:** 600-700 lines

---

### Screen 6: Amenities (Simplest!)

**File:** `apps/partner/app/onboarding/barbershop/amenities.tsx`

**Pattern:** Copy from barber `basic-info.tsx` specializations section

```typescript
const AMENITIES = [
  'WiFi',
  'Air Conditioning',
  'Parking',
  'Wheelchair Accessible',
  'TV/Entertainment',
  'Refreshments',
  'Prayer Room',
  'Kids Play Area',
  'Waiting Area',
  'Card Payment',
  'E-Wallet Payment',
];

const [selectedAmenities, setSelectedAmenities] = useState<string[]>([]);

// Toggle amenity
const toggle = (amenity: string) => {
  if (selectedAmenities.includes(amenity)) {
    setSelectedAmenities(selectedAmenities.filter(a => a !== amenity));
  } else {
    setSelectedAmenities([...selectedAmenities, amenity]);
  }
};

// Save (amenities optional - no validation needed)
await barbershopOnboardingService.saveProgress('amenities', selectedAmenities);
router.push('/onboarding/barbershop/payout');
```

**UI:** Multi-select chips (same as barber specializations)

**Estimated:** 300-350 lines

---

### Screen 7: Payout

**File:** `apps/partner/app/onboarding/barbershop/payout.tsx`

**Pattern:** **LITERALLY COPY** `apps/partner/app/onboarding/barber/payout.tsx`

**Changes needed:**
1. Change import: `barbershopOnboardingService`
2. Change route: `/onboarding/barbershop/review`
3. Update progress dots (8 dots, 7 completed, 1 active)

**That's it!** Same banks, same validation, same everything.

**Estimated:** 418 lines (exact copy)

---

### Screen 8: Review & Submit

**File:** `apps/partner/app/onboarding/barbershop/review.tsx`

**Pattern:** Similar to barber review but 7 sections instead of 4

```typescript
// Load all progress
const progress = await barbershopOnboardingService.getProgress();

// Display sections:
1. Business Info (name, description, contact)
2. Location (full address, coordinates)
3. Documents (logo ‚úì, cover images: X photos, SSM ‚úì, License ‚úì)
4. Operating Hours (days open: MON,TUE,WED...)
5. Staff & Services (X staff, Y services)
6. Amenities (list)
7. Payout (bank, masked account)

// On Submit
const result = await barbershopOnboardingService.submitOnboarding(user.id, progress);

if (result.success) {
  router.replace('/pending-approval');
}
```

**Estimated:** 600-650 lines

---

## üìä Final Line Count Estimate

**Total Onboarding Code:**
- Barber: 2,528 lines ‚úÖ
- Barbershop (complete): ~3,740 lines
- Service: 377 lines ‚úÖ
- **Grand Total: ~6,645 lines**

---

## üéØ Implementation Priority

### Option A: Quick Copy/Paste (1-2 hours)
1. **Amenities** - Copy from barber specializations ‚ö°
2. **Payout** - Direct copy from barber ‚ö°‚ö°
3. **Staff & Services** - New dynamic list logic üî®
4. **Review** - Adapt from barber review üî®

### Option B: AI-Assisted (10 minutes)
Ask me to generate each remaining screen individually:
- "Generate staff-services screen"
- "Generate amenities screen"  
- "Generate barbershop payout screen"
- "Generate barbershop review screen"

**Recommend Option B** if you want consistent code quality.
