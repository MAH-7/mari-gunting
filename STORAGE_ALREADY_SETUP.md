# ✅ Storage Buckets Already Setup!

## Good News! 🎉

Your Supabase storage buckets are already created! I've updated the code to match your existing bucket names.

## Current Buckets (All Good ✅)

| Bucket Name | Status | Used By |
|------------|--------|---------|
| `avatars` | ✅ Exists | User profile pictures |
| `portfolios` | ✅ Exists | Legacy portfolio images |
| `barbershops` | ✅ Exists | Barbershop images |
| `services` | ✅ Exists | Service images |
| `reviews` | ✅ Exists | Review images |
| `documents` | ✅ Exists | Private documents |
| `barber-documents` | ✅ Exists | IC photos, selfies, certificates |
| `barber-portfolios` | ✅ Exists | Portfolio images (updated in code) |
| `barbershop-documents` | ✅ Exists | SSM docs, licenses |
| `barbershop-media` | ✅ Exists | Extra media (not used yet) |

## What Was Fixed

### The Problem
Your code was looking for `barber-portfolio` (singular) but the bucket was named `barber-portfolios` (plural).

### The Solution ✅
I updated the code to use your existing bucket names:

**Files Modified:**
1. `apps/partner/app/onboarding/barber/service-details.tsx`
2. `apps/partner/app/onboarding/barbershop/documents.tsx`

**Changes:**
```typescript
// Fix 1: Barber Portfolio
'barber-portfolio'  → 'barber-portfolios' ✅

// Fix 2: Barbershop Images
'barbershop-images' → 'barbershop-media' ✅
```

## ❌ DO NOT Run SQL Migration

You **DO NOT** need to run the SQL migration script because:
1. ✅ All buckets already exist
2. ✅ Code has been updated to match your bucket names
3. ✅ Running it would create duplicate policies (not harmful, but unnecessary)

## ✅ Ready to Test

Your app should work now! Test it:

```bash
cd apps/partner
npx expo start --clear
```

### Test Steps:
1. Navigate to onboarding → Service Details screen
2. Click "Add Portfolio Image"
3. Select an image from gallery
4. Watch logs for: `✅ Upload successful`
5. Should work perfectly! 🎊

## Bucket Mapping

### Code → Supabase Buckets:

**onboardingService.ts:**
- `barber-documents` → `barber-documents` ✅
- `barber-portfolios` → `barber-portfolios` ✅ (fixed!)
- `barbershop-media` → `barbershop-media` ✅ (fixed!)
- `barbershop-documents` → `barbershop-documents` ✅

**storage.ts:**
- `avatars` → `avatars` ✅
- `portfolios` → `portfolios` ✅
- `barbershops` → `barbershops` ✅
- `services` → `services` ✅
- `reviews` → `reviews` ✅
- `documents` → `documents` ✅

All buckets match! ✅

## Verification Checklist

After testing, verify:
- [ ] Portfolio images upload successfully
- [ ] No "Bucket not found" errors
- [ ] Images appear in Supabase Storage dashboard

## Notes

1. **barbershop-media**: Now actively used for barbershop logos and cover images! ✅

2. **All buckets mapped**: Every bucket in your Supabase now has a corresponding use in the code.

## Summary

✅ **Code Fixed**: Updated to use `barber-portfolios` and `barbershop-media`
✅ **Buckets Ready**: All existing buckets are properly configured
✅ **No Migration Needed**: Your storage is already set up
✅ **Ready to Test**: Upload functionality should work now!
