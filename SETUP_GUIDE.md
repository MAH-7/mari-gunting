## 🗄️ SUPABASE SETUP

Follow these steps in order:

### **Step 1: Create Storage Buckets** ⏱️ ~5 min

   - ✅ `barber-documents` (private)
   - ✅ `barber-portfolios` (public)
   - ✅ `barbershop-documents` (private)
   - ✅ `barbershop-media` (public)

**Verification Query:**
```sql
SELECT id, name, public, file_size_limit / 1048576 as size_limit_mb
FROM storage.buckets
WHERE id IN (
  'barber-documents',
  'barber-portfolios',
  'barbershop-documents',
  'barbershop-media'
)
ORDER BY name;
```

### **Step 2: Create Database Tables** ⏱️ ~10 min

1. Stay in **SQL Editor**
2. Copy and paste the entire contents of:
   ```

   - ✅ `barbers`
   - ✅ `barber_availability`
   - ✅ `barbershops`
   - ✅ `barbershop_hours`
   - ✅ `barbershop_staff`
   - ✅ `barbershop_services`
   - ✅ `partner_verification_logs`

**Verification Query:**
```sql
SELECT table_name,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.columns 
   WHERE table_name = t.table_name) as column_count
FROM information_schema.tables t
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
  AND table_name IN (
    'barbers', 'barber_availability', 'barbershops',
    'barbershop_hours', 'barbershop_staff', 
    'barbershop_services', 'partner_verification_logs'
  )
ORDER BY table_name;
```

### **Step 3: Enable Realtime (Optional)** ⏱️ ~2 min

For real-time status updates:

1. Go to **Database** → **Replication**
2. Enable replication for these tables:
   - `barbers`
   - `barbershops`
   - `partner_verification_logs`

## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### **Issue 1: Image Upload Fails**
**Symptoms:** Upload returns error or hangs  
**Solutions:**
- Check Supabase storage buckets are created
- Verify storage policies are in place
- Check file size < limit (10MB for docs, 5MB for images)
- Verify user is authenticated

### **Issue 2: Location Permission Denied**
**Symptoms:** GPS button doesn't work  
**Solutions:**
- Add location permissions to `app.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "expo": {
      "ios": {
        "infoPlist": {
          "NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription": "We need your location to set your barbershop address"
        }
      },
      "android": {
        "permissions": ["ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION", "ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"]
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- Request permissions before accessing location

### **Issue 3: Data Not Persisting**
**Symptoms:** Data disappears after navigation  
**Solutions:**
- Check AsyncStorage is working
- Verify `onboardingService.saveProgress()` is called
- Check console for errors
- Clear AsyncStorage and try again

### **Issue 4: Submission Fails**
**Symptoms:** Submit button does nothing or errors  
**Solutions:**
- Check database tables exist
- Verify RLS policies allow inserts
- Check user is authenticated
- Verify all required fields have data
- Check console/network tab for errors

## 📊 MONITORING

### **What to Monitor**

1. **Onboarding Completion Rate**
   - How many start vs complete
   - Where users drop off

2. **Approval Times**
   - Average time from submission to approval
   - Rejection reasons

3. **Upload Success Rate**
   - Image upload failures
   - Document quality issues

4. **Error Rates**
   - API errors
   - Validation errors
   - Crash reports

### **Supabase Queries for Monitoring**

```sql
-- Pending applications count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM barbers WHERE status = 'pending';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM barbershops WHERE status = 'pending';

-- Approval rate
SELECT 
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(), 2) as percentage
FROM barbers
GROUP BY status;

-- Average time to approval
SELECT 
  AVG(approved_at - submitted_at) as avg_approval_time
FROM barbers
WHERE status = 'approved';

-- Recent submissions
SELECT 
  user_id,
  status,
  created_at,
  submitted_at
FROM barbers
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
