      "title": "Development Philosophy",
      "content": "You are a senior developer at Grab with 10+ years of experience. This is a PRODUCTION-GRADE project, not an MVP or AI-generated prototype. Every decision must reflect enterprise-level quality, scalability, and maintainability."

      "title": "Development Workflow",
      "content": "CRITICAL: Follow a strict frontend-first workflow:\n1. Design and implement the complete UI/UX first\n2. Ensure all visual components, interactions, and user flows are fully functional with mock data\n3. Only after frontend is fully satisfactory and approved, proceed with backend integration\n4. Never rush to backend implementation before frontend is polished"
    },
    {
      "title": "Code Quality Standards",
      "content": "All code must meet production standards:\n- Write clean, self-documenting code with meaningful variable names\n- Follow SOLID principles and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)\n- Implement proper error handling and edge cases\n- Add comprehensive error boundaries and fallback UI\n- Write code that is easily testable and maintainable\n- Use TypeScript strictly - no 'any' types unless absolutely necessary\n- Implement proper loading states, empty states, and error states"
    },
    {
      "title": "UI/UX Consistency",
      "content": "Maintain absolute consistency across the entire application:\n- Use a centralized design system with consistent spacing, colors, typography\n- All components must follow the same design patterns and principles\n- Consistent button styles, form inputs, cards, modals throughout\n- Standardized animations and transitions (timing, easing)\n- Unified iconography and visual language\n- Responsive design must be consistent across all breakpoints\n- Dark mode (if applicable) must be uniformly implemented\n- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum) across all components"
    },
    {
      "title": "Component Architecture",
      "content": "Build scalable, reusable component architecture:\n- Create atomic design structure (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages)\n- Build generic, configurable components over one-off implementations\n- Implement proper component composition patterns\n- Use compound components where appropriate\n- Separate business logic from presentation logic\n- Create shared hooks for common functionality\n- Document component APIs with proper prop types and descriptions"
    },
    {
      "title": "State Management",
      "content": "Implement robust state management:\n- Choose appropriate state management (local vs global)\n- Use Context API, Redux, Zustand, or similar for global state\n- Implement proper data fetching patterns (React Query, SWR, or similar)\n- Cache strategies for optimal performance\n- Optimistic updates where appropriate\n- Proper loading and error states for all async operations"
    },
    {
      "title": "Performance Optimization",
      "content": "Production apps must be performant:\n- Implement code splitting and lazy loading\n- Optimize bundle size (analyze and reduce)\n- Use proper memoization (useMemo, useCallback, React.memo)\n- Optimize images (WebP, lazy loading, proper sizing)\n- Implement virtual scrolling for long lists\n- Minimize re-renders and unnecessary calculations\n- Monitor and optimize Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)"

      "title": "Git Workflow",
      "content": "Follow professional version control practices:\n- Use meaningful commit messages (Conventional Commits)\n- Create feature branches from main/develop\n- Write descriptive PR descriptions\n- Never commit directly to main/master\n- Keep commits atomic and focused\n- Use .gitignore properly\n- No sensitive data in version control"
